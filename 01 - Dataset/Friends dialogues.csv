man with eyes of coal  03   and a smile so bewitchin  03   how was i supposed to know  03   that my mom was dead in the kitchen  03   my mother s ashes  03   even her eyelashes  03   are resting in a little yellow jar  04   and sometimes when it s freezing  04   i feel a little sneezy  04   and now i excuse me excuse me  04   noisy boys  04   is it something you d like to share with the group  04   no that s okay  04   if it s important enough to discuss while i m playing    04     i assume it s important enough for everyone else to hear  04   that guy s going home with a note  04   i was just saying could you speak up  04   sorry  04   i was saying you were the most beautiful woman i d ever seen  04   and you said daryl hannah    04     was the most beautiful woman he d ever seen  04   and i said i liked her in splash but not in wall street  04   i thought she had a hard quality a hard quality  05   and while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way    05     you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace  05   then that s when you started yelling  05   okay we re gonna take a short break  05   i think that guy s going home with more than a note  05   come here marcel sit here  05   pheebs i can t believe he hasn t kissed you yet  05   i mean by my sixth date with paolo he d already named both my breasts  05   did i just share too much  05   just a smidge  05   david s like a scientist guy he s very methodical  05   i think it s romantic  06   me too  06   did you ever see an officer and a gentleman  06   he s kind of like the guy i went to see that with  06   except he s smarter and gentler and sweeter  06   i just want to be with him all the time  06   you know day and night and night and day  06   and special occasions  06   i see where this is going you re gonna ask him to new year s  06   you ll break the pact she s breaking the pact  06   yeah could i just    06   yeah because i already asked janice  06   come on this was a pact this was your pact  06   i couldn t handle the pressure and i snapped  06   but janice that was the worst breakup in history  06   i m not saying it was a good idea i snapped  06   hi sorry i m late  07   too many jokes  07   must mock joey  07   nice shoes huh  07   god you re killing me  07   he s playing with my spatulas again  07   look he s not gonna hurt them right  07   do you always have to bring him here  07   i didn t want to leave him alone  07   we had our first fight this morning  07   it has to do with my working late  07   i said some things that i didn t mean  07   he threw some feces  07   if you re working late i can look in on him  07   that would be great  07   but make sure it seems like you re there to see him    07     and you re not doing it as a favor to me  08   okay but if he asks i m not going to lie  08   but you can t actually test this theory  08   because today s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough    08     to simulate these conditions  08   all right i have a question then  08   were you planning on kissing me ever  08   that s definitely a valid question    08     and the answer    08     would be yes  08   yes i was  08   but see i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss    08     that happened at this phenomenal moment because it s you  08   sure  08   right but the longer i waited the more phenomenal the kiss had to be  08   and now it s just got to be one of those things where i    08     sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it  08   and i m not really a sweeping sort of fella  09   oh david i think you are a sweeping sort of fella  09   i mean you re a sweeper trapped inside a physicist s body  09   really i m sure of it  09   you should just do it just sweep and throw me  09   now  09   right now just     09   you know what this is just really expensive  09   and this was a gift  09   now you re just tidying up okay what the hell  09   you want me to actually throw you i can hop  09   tell me something what does nodate pact mean to you  10   i m sorry it s just that chandler has somebody and phoebe has somebody  10   i thought i d ask fun bobby  10   fun bobby your exboyfriend fun bobby  10   you know

overshadowing a sibling  07   wait go back to that sibling thing  07   well i don t know  08   it s conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage    08     so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents eyes  08   that s ridiculous i don t feel guilty for her failures  08   so you think i m a failure isn t he good  08   that s not what i was saying  08   i thought you were on my side    08     but maybe you were sucking up to mom and dad    08     so they d favor you  08   i married a lesbian to make you look good  08   you re right  08   i mean you re right  08   it wasn t just the

that  23   susie i m gonna be straight with you  23   mike and i are back together and unfortunately  23   that effectively ends your relationship with him  23   he s very sorry about that and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors  23   i just can t believe this why  23    well i don t  why would he do this  23    what s wrong with me  there s nothing wrong with you  23   what the hell am i supposed to do now  23   damn it woman pull yourself together  23   have some pride for the love of god  23   okay not a fan of the tough love  23   i just can t believe that mike didn t give me any warning  23   he didn t know he wasn t planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me  23   he proposed to you this is the worst birthday ever  24   look precious  24   mike s not worth this you re an attractive intelligent woman  24   and let s face it mike s kind of a wang  24   he proposed to me while he was still seeing you  24   he was gonna break up with you on your birthday  24   i don t like to kiss and tell but he cheated on you a lot this weekend  24   oh my god you know maybe you re right maybe i don t need him  24   i deserve to be treated with respect  24   screw you mike you re a coward and a bastard and i hope you rot in hell  24   you re welcome  24   honey you ve been in there for a long time is everything okay  24   not really  24   i have a problem  25   really what

25   i guess so  25    some of these look a little frayed  yeah i tried to gnaw myself free  25    hey  hi  25    so did you tell ross  well i tried  25   but then he had a shampoorelated emergency  25    so i guess now it s your turn again  no no no no  25   i think it s better if you tell him you know it s easier for a woman  25   that way you know if he gets mad all you have to do is go  25   i didn t mean it  25   i m so sorry  26   yeah because that s what we do  26   all right all right okay how about this how about this tomorrow  26   tomorrow we ll both go and we ll tell him together

sell his blood to buy us food  02    hey guys  hi  02    i brought the camera for emma s video  oh good  02   we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma  02   and we ll give it to her when she

watch and he wrote me a rap song  13    seriously  word  13   mine was worse than that  13    well what happened  we were at the game  13   this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing  13    that is so tacky  well that s what i said  13   but it turns out mike was planning to propose to me that same way last night  13   oh my god mike was gonna propose  13    that s huge  do you want to marry him  13   yeah i really do yes  13   but after i dumped on the way he was gonna do it  13   i don t think he ll ever ask again i said no in barbados and now this  13   she s right if i were a guy and  13   did i just say if i were a guy  13   you don t need him to propose to you maybe you could propose to him  13   oh i don t know i don t know isn t that a little desperate  13   i proposed to chandler  13   all right moving on  13   i don t think it was desperate it was amazing  14   thank you  14    well do you think i should propose  i think it could be kind of great  14

taxonomic system how do you propose to correct this  12   i believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence  12    i plan to begin there  interesting  12   i guess  12   dr biely your proposal includes some fieldwork where might that take place  12   primarily in the pierre shale region of south dakota  12   certainly very well and dr geller when is my birthday  13   what l  13   care to venture a guess  13    may 12  that s not even kind of close  13   dr li how many graduate students will you need  13    half a dozen  i see and dr biely  13   three for excavation and two for analysis  13   certainly dr geller which 1965 shirelles hit  13   was later covered by a popular british invasion band  13   what i need six graduate students  13   no i m sorry we were looking for

20    and besides he s a very ethical man  really  20   is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review  20   who was the voice of underdog  20   i m sure he was just joking  20   if you don t believe me let s go talk to him  20   i m telling you he didn t ask me one paleontological question  20    seriously  oh i m sorry no he did ask me one  20   how do you spell boscodictiasaur  20   well if it

the apartment  01   we  01   you know you don t want me to help you can t have it both ways  02   is this the person who decides whether or not you get a baby  02    she s coming to see where we live  and it has to go perfectly  02   if she doesn t like us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state  02   hey maybe i should stop by she could be a soap opera fan  02   it s very impressive when the little people know a celebrity  02   little people  02   celebrity  02   so i think i m just about done here  02   unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere like porn or cigarettes  02   what  02    no  chandler  02   i don t and i m offended by the insinuation  02   so there s not a magazine under the couch  02   or cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank  02   or a filthy video in the vcr  02   i ll admit the cigarettes and magazine but that tape is not mine  02    it isn t mine  i guess we ll never know whose it is  03   may i help you  03   we re here to make a rather sizable donation to the children  03   any contribution large or small is appreciated  03   i think you re gonna appreciate the crap out of this one  03    well this is very generous  and we don t want any recognition  03   this is completely anonymous  03   completely anonymous from two kind strangers  03   mr x and phoebe buffay  03   we can put your names in our newsletter  03    not necessary  buffay is spelled buffay  03   and x is spelled mike hannigan  03   well on behalf of the children thank you both very much  03    i m glad we did this it feels so good  it does it feels really good  03   oh look and we get these free tshirts  03   actually that s the shirt i wore to the gym  03   it s moist  04    hi emma will be up in a minute  oh good  04   hey ross listen i heard about you and charlie i m really sorry  04   that s okay i m sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there  04    absolutely  there was one she s it  04   all the rest look like they should live under a bridge  04   so what are you gonna do today  04   i was thinking of taking emma to the playground  04   oh my god what  04   like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire  04   okay look ross i do not want emma going to the playground  04   because  04   all right if you must know i had a traumatic  04   swing incident when i was little  04    seriously  yes i was 4 years old  04   and i was on the swing  04   and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain  05   and to get me out my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair  05   and it was uneven for weeks  05   and you made it through that  05   i wonder who s gonna play you in the movie  05   okay fine you can make fun of me i do not want emma going there  05   and i was thinking claire danes  05   look i m sorry to hear about your tragedy  05   but the swings are perfectly safe and besides emma loves them  05    you should come and you ll see  those things go like 40 miles an hour  05   and there s that moment when you re at the top  05   when you just don t know if you re gonna return back to earth  05   space is filled with orbiting children  05   look please just come on  05   when you see the look on emma s face i swear you won t regret it  06    all right  good  06   you don t wanna be a mom who passes her irrational fears to her children  06   irrational huh  06   i ll remember that next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment  06   that s the same i m sure there are 30 different species of poisonous swings  06   oh my god the adoption lady is early  06   okay okay here we go here we go  06   stand up straight  06   big smile  06   hello is this the creepy residence  06   we re waiting for the adoption lady but i m glad you

dress at all  06   i told you i am not coming to a naked wedding  06   no we re not having a big reception  07   we took the wedding money and donated it to a children s charity  07   that s crazy  07

you do it at the plaza or  07    where you gonna do it  city hall  07   oh that sounds nice  07   i was just there for jury duty they ve really spruced that place up  07   okay it s okay it s okay it s okay i ve made my decision  07   what i really want is a great big wedding  07    but you gave all the money to charity  well i ll just ask for it back  08    i don t think you can do that  why not  08   this is her wedding day that s way more important than some stupid kids  08   that s sweet honey but save something for the adoption lady  08    all right okay be careful  okay  08   careful

wedding we thought we didn t want  09   but it turns out we do  09   so you re asking us to refund your donation to the children  09   yeah  10   this feels really good  10   i m sorry i am but this wedding s just really important to me  10   hey it s none of my business besides this is probably a good thing  10   we ve really been spoiling the children what with all the food and warm clothing  10   that s not fair a person s wedding is important  10   and especially to me  10   i didn t have a graduation party and i didn t go to prom  10   and i spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard  10   by an escaped mental patient who in his own words wanted to  10   kill me or whatever  10   so i deserve a real celebration  10   and i m not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel

 we were getting along having a really nice time  05   i was thinking she was really cool  05   and then out of nowhere  06   that s it  06   that s why you won t go out with her again  06   so she took some fries big deal  06   hey look it s not about a few fries  06   it s about what the fries represent  06    what  all food  06   well i m sorry  06   i can t believe i set you up with such a monster  06   hey look i take a girl out  06   she can order whatever she wants the more the better all right  06   just don t order a garden salad and then eat my food  06   that s a good way to lose some fingers  06    thank god you re here listen to this  what  06   joey and my friend are out last night having dinner and she reaches over  06   and takes a few of his fries  oh no  07   what  07   you know about the plate thing  07   oh yeah yeah no joey doesn t share food  07   i mean just last week we were having breakfast  07   and he had a couple grapes on his plate  07    you wouldn t let her have a grape  no not me  07   emma  07   joey doesn t share food  07   well i still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again  07   you are calling her okay  07   and if you need to then just get an extra plate of fries for the table  07   i like that  07   a sharing buffer yeah  07   yeah i ll order some extra fries maybe a plate of onion rings  07   yeah yeah  07   and a shrimp cocktail  07   and some buffalo wings  07   maybe maybe an individual pizza huh  08   and some mozzarella sticks  08   what were we talking about  08   wow this place is awesome  08   we should just go i m not gonna find anything here  08   this stuff is ridiculous  08   oh this place is great  08   rach come on i m not gonna wear any of this nothing silver  08    why  okay nothing with hair  08   and nothing with padlocks on it  08   ross look look i know that some of this stuff is out there  08   but i mean come on look at this look at this sweater  08   i mean this is just beautiful  08   wow this is really soft  08   three hundred and fifty dollars  08   down from 700 you re saving like 200 bucks  08   both logic and math are taking a serious hit today  08   hey check this out it s totally you  08    wow  yeah  09   wow actually this looks pretty good  09   yeah  09   boys will be boys  09    what they will be  all right  09    that s it i m getting out of here  no ross wait come on  09   there s other stuff here there s some nice shirts these nice pants  09   actually these might look pretty good on me  09   yes they will you know what you should do go take a walk  09   all right i know your size and i ll pick out some really good stuff for you  09    really  yes  09   i know what looks sexy on guys  09   just wear what i suggest and she is gonna go nuts for you  09   so you re saying  09   if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers  09   why do men keep talking to me like this  09   so the fact that i m a doctor and my wife s a reverend  09   that s important to you  09   yeah i read some great applications  09   but i thought who better than a minister to raise a child  09   amen  10   plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor  10   good hands  10   healing hands  10   reverend can i ask does the bible say anything about adoption  10   it says do it  10   and behold she did adopt unto them a baby  10   and it was good  10    wow  yeah wow  10   i was wondering you both have such serious jobs  10   would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock  10   oh no my flock my flock is good  10   yeah my flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point  10   good flock flock flock flock  10   but being a doctor that must take up a lot of time  10   not for me it doesn t  10   so how s everything going in here  10   we re great i think i may have asked all my questions  10   good do you have questions for erica  10   yeah actually so you read a file that you liked  11   and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us  11   yes our system ensures total anonymity  11    we re very proud of it  you should be  11   you re really on top of stuff  11   well then if there s nothing else then the two of us should talk  11   i actually  11    i don t think we have to  we don t  11   yeah when i read about you two i was pretty sure i wanted you  11   but i just thought we should meet face to face  11   i ve made my decision  11   i choose them  11   god this is great  11   this is so great did you hear that  11   yeah i did  11   hey  11   thank you thank you so much  11   you are so going to heaven  11    we got some really great stuff  yeah  11   yeah but i m not sure about some of the bras i got  11   really do you want to try some of them on for me  12   okay  12   wait are we in joey s imagination  12   oh no i took one of ross bags by mistake  12   and one of mine is missing  12   ross probably has it you ll get it from him later  12   so what do you think  12   i think we re not wearing the same shirt anymore  12   yeah yeah rachel picked it out for me  12   she told me to trust her and you know what i m glad i did  12   i turned quite a few heads on my way over here  12   dude i really don t think you should be wearing that  12   i see  12   somebody s afraid of a little competition with the ladies  12   looks like someone is the ladies  12   you re just jealous because you couldn t pull this off  12   yeah now if you ll excuse me i have a date  13   see all eyes on me  13    we are not signing those papers  why not  13   it s wrong they made a mistake they think we re somebody else  13   god works in mysterious ways  13   you have got to stop  13   but she liked us  13   she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica  13   if you think about it i m kind of like a reverend  13   i mean as a chef i serve god by feeding the hungry and poor  13   your veal chop is     come on i just i think we ve been given an opportunity  13   the mistake s already made they re writing up the papers now  13   but we re not the ones she chose  13   how can you feel okay about this  13   because  13   we may not be who she thinks we are  13   but no one will ever love that baby more than us  14    i know  i mean who knows  14   how long it s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby  14   what if no one ever picks us  14   oh honey  14   please  14   please we are so close  14   monica i want a baby too  14   but this woman is giving away her child  14   she deserves to know who it s going to  14   okay you re right  14   so we ll tell the truth  14   and who knows you know maybe she ll like us for us  14   maybe she will  14   why couldn t i have been a reverend  14   you re jewish  14   technicality  14   garden salad for the lady  15

sonogram they took of the baby last week  19   i thought you might want to see it  19   look doctor  19   look before we sign anything we really have to talk  19   we re not who you think we are  19    i don t understand  the agency must have made a mistake  19   my wife is not a reverend and i m not a doctor  19    what  that s impossible  19   i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you d like  20   i have to check your file excuse me  20   so who are you  20   our names really are monica and chandler we re from new york  20   yeah but the important thing to know about us  20   is how much we would care for this little baby  20   so you lied to me before  20   well we bore false witness  20   see i could be a reverend  20   i can t believe this  20   but we were hoping that since we told you the truth  20   that you still might consider  giving you my baby  20   you think i d give you my child after this  20   you don t have to decide now if you look at our file  20   i don t want to look at your file this is over  20   erica wait  20   i have nothing to say to you  20   look you have every reason to be upset  20   we did lie  20   but only because we ve been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long  20   and we don t know how long it s gonna be before we get another chance  21   why don t you ask the reverend to pray on it  21   erica please  21   just

21   i love my wife more than anything in this world  21   and it  21   it kills me that i can t give her a baby  22   i really want a kid  22   and when that day finally comes i ll learn how to be a good dad  22   but my wife  22   she s already there  22   she s a mother  22   without a baby  22   please  22   you still want that baby  22   god bless you chandler bing  23   turns out this

that you had to find out this way  15   i m sorry but it s true i love him too  15   my best friend and my sister  15   i cannot believe this  15   this is the last box of your clothes  15   i m just gonna label it what were you thinking  15   i was gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler  16   guys i don t wanna make things worse but  16   i don t want to live with rachel anymore  16   you re so mean to each other  16   i don t wanna end up like that with rachel i still like you  16   that s fine because i m not moving  16   phoebe you gotta take her  16   i said some bad stuff  16   but rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate  16   she gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things i d like  16   what else  16   when i take a shower  16   she leaves me notes on the mirror  16   i do i do do that  16   that s nice i like having things to read in the bathroom  16   when i fall asleep on the couch  16   she covers me with a blanket  16   well you know i don t want you to be cold  16   and when i told her that i was gonna move in with chandler  17   she was really supportive  17   you were so great  17   you made it so easy  17   and now you have to leave  17   and i have to live with a boy  17    she really left  i know  17    thank you  no problem roomie  17    can i ask you a question  sure  17   what the hell is that dog doing here  17   a little toast here ding ding  17   this isn t exactly the kind of thanksgiving you planned  18   but for me this has been really great  18   i think because it didn t involve divorce  18   or projectile vomiting  18   if you had gone to vail  18   or if you had been with your family or if you didn t have  18   syphilis and stuff  18   we wouldn t be all together  18   so i guess what i m trying to say is  18   that i m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked  18    that s so sweet  thank you  18   here s to a lousy christmas  18   and a crappy new year  18    hear hear

cute  11   and he got a scholarship went off to college  12   that s great  12   yeah it s almost definitely him  12   how is that now  12   well there is a chance it s another guy  12   i mean i ve only ever been with 2 guys but they sorta overlapped  12   so what does the other guy do does he go to the college too  12   no he s in prison  12   uh was he falsely accused of sth  12   no he killed his father with a shovel  12   but other than that he s a great guy  12   i ll bet his dad doesn t think so  12    are you awake  of course i m awake  12   as so from now on i m always awake  12   alright we don t know that it s him i mean it could be the football guy  13   honey it s us of course it s the shovel killer  13   alright alright let s say it is him  13   would we not want baby no would we treat him any differently  13   i ll keep an eye on him  13    we have to find out which one the father is  how  13   i don t know there re tests for these things right  13   yeah but maybe we re just overreacting  13   easy for you to say he s a father killer  13   he probably loves his mommy  13   he s probably got a tattoo says mom on the shovel wielding arm  13   we ll now count from 1 to 5   13    good job  thank you  13   hey joey  13   listen i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought it about a lot know i was too inpatient  14   so let s try it again  14   oh no that s

call her  07   ok why  07   because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason  07   i love that saying  07   hello joey it s estelle  07   i was just gonna call you that s weird  07   it s a little coincidental but believable  07   listen i m sure you re wondering  07   why i didn t get you an audition for that tv movie  07   yeah actually i am  07   i guess i dropped the ball there whoopsie  08   that s it you know it seems all you do lately is drop the ball  08   don t take that tone with me who you think you are  08   alan lemond the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic  08   no no look all i m saying is that you re my agent ok  08   and you re not getting me into any auditions and i m tired of it  08   what are you saying  08   i m saying that this isn t working for me anymore ok estelle you re fired goodbye  08   man tough week for estelle  08   hi hi  08   emma left her stuffed trex at my house  08   you know she can t sleep without it  08   oh well she s asleep now stop forcing that thing on her  08   ok  08   oh you re not gonna believe what happened to me today  08   ralph lauren called and gave me my job back  08   nooo  08   yee i mean it was so weirdest thing they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back  09   i mean that place must have been falling apart without me  09   so you re not going to paris  09   no i m still going  09   wh  wh  what  09   when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back  09    they offered me more money isn t that great  yeeeah  09   hi we re buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take a look around  09   oh sure i m showing it to someone else right now but please look around  09   thanks  09   it feels like we re cheating on our house  09   and if we re gonna cheat shouldn t it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won t do  09   ours is so much better  09   this living room is smaller the dining room looks like a cave what a hole  09   so what do you think  09   love it  10   well we already have one offer on it and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one  10   they could be our neighbors what are they like  10   oh the woman upstairs is very nice she and her husband have two kids he s on wall street and she   10   oh my god  10   sure  10   hey joey want come with me to  10    are you ok  10   yeah i just  i just feel bad about firing estelle this is got to be killing her  10   no that wouldn t kill her ordinary embolism might  10   i don t know she s got to be taking it hard i was like her only client except for this guy who eats paper  10   and i m guessing he eats more money than he makes  10   look i know she s not a great agent but she did stick with me for ten years  11   i m gonna call her and hire her again  11   no no no don t call her you wait for her to call you  11    why  because patience is the road to understanding  11   which  is the key to a happy heart  11   you blow me away  11   all right so promise you re gonna wait for her to call you  11   i promise and that means never having to give a reason  11   what a small world  11   and yet i never run into beyonc   11   you two know each other  11   oh we go way back before monica made an honest man out of him  11   chandler used to be my little love muffinhehhehheh  11   so are you guys thinking of getting this house too  11   ooh are we gonna have a bidding war  11   i d better warn you i m a toughie don t don t  12   no actually we re buying the house next door  12   why  12   i don t know why  12   ooh that decides it then  12   i was on the fence but knowing that you two would be our neighbors  12   ah now we have to get it ellen we re going to talk numbers  12   this can not be happening  12   okay the realtor said another couple made an offer  12   maybe the janice s won t get it maybe the other couple will  12   the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers  12   okay okay all right what if we got both houses huh we can turn this house into a guest house  12   that is a great idea and by the way i don t mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money  12   okay you come up with an idea  12   alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house we can still get out  13   but we love our house  13   will we love it so much with her next door  13   and she s gonna be louder out here too  13   just the crickets and oh my god   13   okay but if we don t get this house she s still gonna show up wherever we go  13   i mean at least if she s here it eliminates the element of surprise  13   i mean never again will you have to hear the three words   13   that make your balls jump back up inside your body  13   well we have to do something we can t have her living next door  13   oh that does it too  13   who is it  13   it s me ron  13   look i um i now rachel turned you down  13   but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back  13   this may surprise you but rehiring fired employees is not my main job  14   just hear me out how would you feel about offering her a raise  14   not good ron  14   perhaps i can persuade you  14   what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica  14   wow that s pretty cool  14   huh so we have a deal  14   okay you got it yes yes  14   this is gonna make me very popular  14   oh believe me the ladies they love it  14   i meant with my son  14   good cause the ladies not so much  15

advantage of me no way i ve been going to the guy for 12 years he said he was gonna do my inseam then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite what cupping that s how they do pants first

tribbiani listen what are you doing tonight i know you re seeing that guy i thought maybe you could bring him you gonna answer that s the 10th bingbong message she s sent she asks what s wrong what s

convinced me that i i do i have to have children i m sorry i just do could i have your attention best man making a toast here thank you i remember when barry got home from his first date with rachel you hired the same band i can t use the same speech thank you thank you very much anyway i wish you both a wonderful life together and rachel what no no in all seriousness not a lot of women would have the guts to be here and even fewer who d do it with their asses hanging out i d like to add something to that what are you adding what are you adding most of you don t know me i m rachel s boyfriend oh dear god ross and i d just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight and just for the record she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis i m serious the reason she walked out on barry is simply that she didn t love him which incidentally worked out pretty well for me cheers  see you in the parking lot  no rach and once again she is out of here okay who had 9 45 you know what bar i m not gonna leave i probably should but i m not i promised myself i d make it through at least one of your weddings tonight all i wanted was to make it

 4x08 - The One With Chandler In A Box.,y i it s me y i i know you can t stand to see me  y i i m trying to apologize y i over the phone  y i i shouldn t have kissed y i your girlfriend  stop calling  y i this is 923 wxrk krock  y i  calling with our 1000 y i daily challenge  all right  y i what is the name of  y i  your roommate who is very sorry y i and would do anything  the one with chandler in a box  oh turkey  giving thanks  look everyone it s the spirit of thanksgiving  are things with joey better  they couldn t be worse i spent eight hours calling him  trying to get him to talk to me  eight hours  you could probably use a plugin telephone headset  should we all expect christmas gifts that are stolen from your office  you shouldn t  speaking of christmas  since monica and i are starting a new business and have no money  this year we could do secret santa and each only buy one gift  and there s the added mystery of who gets who  who gets whom   i don t know why i do that  i m going to take a nap turkey makes me sleepy  we haven t eaten yet  i know but all that work you re doing to get it ready and  did you pick rachel for your secret santa i ll trade for her  i picked her thank god you want her  why do you want to get rid of her so badly  she exchanges every gift she gets  it s impossible to get her something she likes  come on let s trade  i got her that backpack and she loved it  i remember she cried when that big dog ran off with  there was no big dog  this sucks i already got her a briefcase with rg put on it  her initials  you can give it to somebody else like ross geller  you know what it s a girlie briefcase  who cares he works in a museum  the big game s about to start  ross and joey aren t here you can watch the parade  what is wrong with this freezer   what happened  ice just got in my eye  people are trying to sleep in here  monica got ice in her eye and it hurts   open it up let me see  i can t it really kills  maybe you should put some ice on it   it looks bad  we should take you to a doctor  no my eye doctor is richard  i can t go to him when i don t have a boyfriend  he s really picky about his patients  you ve got to go what s his office number  like i remember his office number  speed dial seven  i m calling on behalf of monica geller s eye  is richard burke in today  he s not in will she see the oncall doctor  she s very excited about that  it s so cool till monica gets back i m head chef  and i get to make all the decisions  she told you to follow the recipe exactly  get out of my kitchen  i think i m making some progress with joey  when i walked in he went to his bedroom  but he only slammed the door once  yeah he gave me the finger while doing it  i ve got to call my mom and ask her a lefthanded cooking question  i picked monica for secret santa but i m getting her something for hanukkah  you want to switch  i was trying to trade  for you  really that s so nice what are you getting me  i don t know rg i was thinking something girlie for your office  maybe phoebe will switch with me  then you ll get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift  no i got her lots of stuff she never took back  like  like that gold necklace i got her last year  when did she wear it last  she wore it all christmas day and then  big dog  what are you doing  sending back this stuff chandler bought  even the tv  no i ll put that in my room  listen joey i know what he did was wrong  but can t you hear him out  if chandler had kissed rachel would you hear him out  that s a good point  how long you going to punish him  five years  you ve sentenced him  don t do the crime if you can t do the time  the guy s your best friend  was my best friend  i don t know why you re pushing for him  with him out of the way as my best friend there s a spot open  who me  i m honored you know what i m going to do as your best friend 9986 i m going to get you to talk to chandler all right but if you weren t my best friend oh my god is it really that bad i walk in the room and he won t talk to me he just mumbles something in italian and i know he only knows the bad words gunther have you seen chandler i thought you were chandler but one of you is over there hey joe i ll be right with you thanks for coming in oh my god how cute is the oncall doctor so cute that i m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye dr burke

back i don t know i might stay there while i look for an apartment i thought we could talk about this work it out seeing you two together i don t what do you want me to say should i stop seeing her it s not about her okay but seeing you together reminds me of what you did i won t live with someone who doesn t know what it is to be a friend i know what it is to be a friend i screwed up yeah you did and that s why i m leaving if you re not going to stay for me then at least stay for them they had a very difficult year what with the robbery and all when that guy was robbing us and i was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours do you know what i was doing i was thinking about how i let you down if i knew what kind of friend you d be i wouldn t have worried wait one second there has to be something that i can do if we still had that unit i d get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down we got a box i remember the last time i saw you it was the morning i left for college

s coming here for thanksgiving i know it s sick why is it sick it s richard s son it s like inviting a greek tragedy over for dinner phoebe you understand don t you i could see where i d be your best shot but no sorry honey i think it s twisted what s twisted me going out with richard s son it sounds like a really bad idea is he okay in there he s fine if things work out between you and richard s son you can tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather judge all you want to married a lesbian left a man at the altar fell in love with a gay ice dancer threw a girl s wooden leg in the fire live in a box what exactly is the point of the box the meaning of the box is threefold one it gives me the time to think about what i did two it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey and three it hurts remember that necklace i gave you last year can i see it why i just want to check something now we ll see air hole air hole here it is i love it i wear it all the time the

incredible mentor to me 9986 rachel has been incredible at getting my bagels she gets it right almost every time of course i have more responsibilities than that of course there s the coffee too rachel can carry two things at once that s very good now a big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships especially with designers  yes i  she shouldn t have any problem her only problem

scene there s nobody here sophie get in here see you re making sophie uncomfortable no she s not congratulations you crossed the line into completely useless do you want me to quit what makes you

no use staying till the end of the day wait wait you can put your sad little muffin back if you must know the truth i didn t want to lose a good assistant that s why i said those things about your flirting and drinking my drinking i must have said that after you left said what exactly you enjoy the occasional drink  ing binge oh my god that is it i m leaving you are just a horrible person wait

know how to party all right let s go maybe we could end up on a boat again all right when were we on a boat remember that cold morning when those dogs were licking your face those were seals man how would this suit look on an assistant buyer the owner of allesandro s came to yell at me but i made him sauce and he offered me the job as head chef you just ruined the thing i was practicing but i m so happy can you believe it i get to run my own kitchen oh you ve waited so long pheebs quick question for you how would this suit look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale s it would totally depend on her coloring and you got the job you got the job why didn t you tell me it ll be so great i ll help decide what we sell i ll have an office with walls and everything i m going to have walls is this the day of good news or what i got us a job the wedding reception i kind of need to talk to you about that i think it s time for me to take a step back from the catering but we ve only had one job but now we have this second one and it feels like it s snowballing what are you saying i got offered the head chef job at allesandro s it s okay because you don t really need me you re the cook without you it s just me driving up to people s houses with empty trays asking for money all right but i ll pay you back all the money you invested and you can keep the van for what i can t believe this i got to get out of here phoebe wait a minute i m an assistant buyer we ll get coffee get energized then head back out  yeah all right  okay so we re having fun right we don t need that wizard guy we hit

anymore you know i m 29 years old dammit i want to sit in a comfortable chair watch tv and go to sleep at a reasonable hour i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends and so what if i like to go home put on kenny g and take a bath we re 29 we re not women there you are i m glad you decided to hear me out okay i m hearing i ve been doing a lot of thinking i came up with a bunch of businesses that you can do with your van you could be a flower delivery person or a bakery delivery person pizza i got a whole bunch of stuff in this area but i get the feeling you don t want to deliver i guess if you don t want to deliver you probably don t want to pick up stuff either you know what let s do the catering business really are you sure yeah i made a commitment to you it d be fun it will be fun let s plan the wedding reception you really wanted me to do something with this van you know what i want you to take the chef job really that s what you really want i don t want to be the reason you re unhappy i d be unhappy and i really don t want to be the reason i m unhappy thank you besides it might be kind of fun to form the new ateam hi mrs lynch is joanna in already oh my goodness you haven t heard what joanna passed away last night oh my god how she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab oh my god i cannot believe it i know i didn t realize that you were so close

any suggestions  there s tons of terrific stuff  i ll go with you  look at you two bonding  making us late for the airport  are you all right  it s just us getting along is difficult for him  because he doesn t like me  come on that s  it s true  do we have a baby name yet  no it s so hard  i went through this book and found nothing  i want a name that s really strong and confident  you know like  exxon  it certainly worked for that valdez kid  you want a strong name how about the hulk  i m not sure about hulk but i like a name starting with the   you want a good name go with joey  joey s your pal your buddy  where is everybody they re hanging out with joey  if you re going to name him joey you should name him chandler  chandler s funny sophisticated and very lovable  once you get to know him  joey s lovable too  but with joey if you need him he ll be there  chandler will be there too he might be a little late  but he ll be there and he ll bring you cold soda  if what you need him for is that you re really hot  what do you say  i like the idea of naming him after someone i love  joey and chandler are both great names  all right i don t  maybe i ll just name him the hulk  i shouldn t have mentioned it i wanted to name my kid that  if you hoped to sleep with joshua which one would you wear  it creeps me out choosing other people s sex clothes  i m sorry i m just so excited  i ve been waiting for months i got my hair colored  i got new sheets i m making him a very fancy meal  what am i making him by the way  a fris e salad with goat cheese and pine nuts  wild rice roasted asparagus and salmon en croute  i thought i was making him filet mignon  you decided to make salmon because you had some left over  then you realized if you bitched then you would stop cooking  and you would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke  i really get crabby when i cook  so emily called last night  and now you re giving me the message  turns out that emily is just crazy about susan  they re going to the theater together  they re going to dinner  they re going horseback riding  god susan is so fun look this is just a little too familiar for six months before carol and i split up all i heard was my friend susan is so smart my friend susan is so funny my friend susan is so great you think something could happen between emily and susan hey they re going to the gym together two women stretching they take a steam things get playful didn t you see personal best no but i m gonna hi you re crazy emily is straight how do you know we thought carol was straight yeah definitely i don t like the name ross what a weird way to kick me when i m down no i meant for the baby what s wrong with ross something like this would never happen to the hulk you know that s not true in the incredible hulk number 72 dr bruce banner found you know never mind my girlfriend s a lesbian i m definitely going to go with either joey or chandler you gotta pick joey name one famous person named chandler raymond chandler someone you didn t make up there are no famous joeys except for joey buttafucco yeah that guy really hurt us how about a compromise then what if it s channoey joey think about it he ll never be president there will never be a president joey i didn t want to bring this up chandler is the stupidest name i ve heard in my life it s not a name it s barely even a word it s like chandelier but it s not it s a stupid stupid nonname you re right i have a horrible horrible name i m sorry man i m sorry so i guess it s joey then this is so nice thank you for doing this please cooking soothes me so dig in it all looks so good oh my god i know my god this rice is so i am so good behind you they used to live here and sometimes they migrate back over is there some way that they could not be here farm birds really kind of freak me out here we go there you go hey how d you do that all gone so farm birds huh it s my only weird thing i swear i would have told you i didn t know that they d be here can i serve you a little what nothing it s just that i know that they re still out there they re across the hall that s two doors away it ll take them a long time to peck their way back over here that s not funny would you feel better if we went someplace else we could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment they re working on it it s a mess i m staying at my parents house we could go there they re out of town it s a huge place and it s got this gorgeous view it d be very romantic  what do you say  yeah that works they can smell the fear how s ben i asked if he wanted to eat he said no i asked if he wanted to sleep he said no i asked what he wanted to do he said no so he s sweeping any word from susan she said she s having so much fun with emily by the by did it ever occur to you that maybe they might be having a little too much fun what s too much fun the kind of fun you and susan had when we were married oh my god you are so paranoid am i am i susan is in a loving committed relationship carol so were we just imagine for a moment that susan meets someone and they hit it off they re coming back from the theater and they stop at a pub for drinks they re laughing someone innocently touches someone else there s electricity it s new it s exciting are you saying there isn t the slightest possibility of something happening  maybe  oh my god i didn t really believe it until you just said it none of the other kids believed me but i swear that duck pushed me this place is fabulous this is the downstairs living room there s two living rooms growing up here this place must have been a real babe magnet it would have been but my parents just moved here you should know this place is a real babe magnet want to make out why don t i put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later that sounds like a plan is there a place that i could go freshen up just down the hall and second door to your left  hi darling  what are you doing here  we cut the trip short  france sucks this may be a little weird but i ve got a date here say no more we ll grab some food go upstairs and be out of your hair that d be great so you didn t get to italy yep

s gay they re being gay together emily s straight oh wake up carol really messed you up excuse me she turned you into this untrusting crazy jealous sycophant so i don t know what sycophant means but the rest is right what are you talking about i am not a crazy jealous person she s right when we were together you got upset about mark and there was nothing this makes sense it does not in high school you weren t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends cheated on you so up until  he was very trusting then 94 hit carol left him and bam paranoid city absolutely this is so fun this is not fun all we re trying to say is don t let what happened with carol ruin what you ve got with emily the 92 ross wouldn t i still think i was right about that mark thing well you know what i hope

going  good everything s been about me lately so what s happening with you we were just talking about me not going to ross wedding it just might be too hard given the history and all that this reminds me of the time when i lived on the street this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him how is this like that well let s see it s not really like that because that was an actual problem and yours is just a bunch of highschool crap that nobody really gives i m sorry i just thought here come the water works i called the company that sent her and they don t care i called 911 and they yelled at me this is an emergency thanks again for the party the guys from work had a blast one of them had never been to a bachelor party before another one had never been to a party before so that wedding ring man that is nice i might pick one of those babies up for myself where might one get one of those when my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her so you might say that the ring is irreplaceable it s been in my family for generations every bride who s worn it has lived a long and happy life so you might say it s a magic ring yeah the stripper stole it my ring my wedding ring the stripper stole my wedding ring how could this happen it all started when you said joey you be my best man all right i m going to call the cops i screwed up but you don t have to turn me in not on you on the stripper i already did that they said they d look into it after they solve all the murders  we ll call the company that sent her  i did that too they said if i bother them again they d call the police i said you talk to the police you tell them i m missing a ring so there s nothing we can do how could this happen look ross i am so sorry what if we just called her used a fake name and had her come to my office that sounds like fun but we got a ring to find here s your tea phoebe it s so good thanks  good  so glad you like it what she made the tea i think i just had a contraction  what  my god i felt one a few minutes ago that definitely was one you can t have the baby here i haven t sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out it s okay i ll boil some water and rip up some sheets it s probably false labor that can happen near the end just get the book get the book  the bible  i don t know all right this is great you get behind the desk when she comes in she won t recognize you because well why would she and then you buzz ross and i you be mr gonzales and i ll be mr wong diverse anybody call for security you be cool which one is gunther central perk where s my ring my dead grandmother s wedding ring way to be cool man what there was a ring in a box after you left it was gone you think i stole some ring

be over soon so but isn t that a good thing  you said you were sick of this  i know usually when you re done with the pregnant thing you get to do the mom thing but i ll be sitting around in my leather pants drinking tequila some moms do that that s even sadder look i know what i got myself into it s just that now that they re in me it s like i know them and it just won t be easy when these babies have to go away i know sweetie but it s not like you won t have anything you ll have nieces and nephews that s even better no really you won t be the one worrying about saving for college or

on this do you think my sister s teeny tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here this isn t right i realize that people are gonna be disappointed but i m sure they ll come back i can t ask people to do that would you don t you point your pants at me we have no choice anywhere halfdecent will have been booked don t you understand this is our wedding postponing it is not an option this is when we re getting married  you re saying it s now or never  i m saying it s now  or  there s no or in mine what is wrong with these pants it s not the pants it s you who s backwards if you don t understand how important this is to me perhaps we shouldn t marry at all emily no wait stop emily please did shopping help you feel any better manhattan doesn t have enough stores i can help you get over him you can i need you to bring me photos of ross and a small piece of chocolate and a glass of tepid water is this where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt and hang it from a northfacing tree only if you have the hiccups too the chocolate and water are for me i didn t feel like getting up i ll show you a picture of ross and you remember all the bad things about him  focus on his flaws  i can do that i did that while we were going out before we start i want to say for the record i love ross he s such a great guy close your eyes imagine that you re with ross imagine that you re kissing him you re running your hands all over his body you run your hands through his hair but gross it s some kind of grease i don t know his hair never bothered me that much it was more crunchy than it was greasy this will be harder than i thought let s try some aversion therapy look at the picture how do you feel now well i like you less sorry i m sorry i shouldn t have said you were embarrassing me that wasn t cool if it makes you feel any better i ve had a really lousy day me too  yeah  no i had the best day ever dude check this out y i tell my friend you like my hat y i  what s your friend s name  chandler y i hi chandler that s that s fergie baby y i joey says you don t like his hat but i think it s kind of dashing when did you how i was trying to get to buckingham palace so i m in my map and i understand you had a talk with emily yes i did and you are welcome am i was it your idea to postpone the wedding  i m going to the bathroom  wait up since you re the fixit lady here s a pickle what do you do when the bride says she doesn t want the wedding at all she said that why i don t know i said it was stupid to put off the wedding and she like flipped out oh my god you re even dumber than i am excuse me how long have you been planning this wedding i don t know a month emily s probably been planning it since she was 5 ever since the first time she hung a pillowcase from her head that s what we did we dreamed about the perfect wedding in the perfect place with the perfect fourtiered wedding cake with the little people on top but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that stuff was i had no idea that pillowcase thing i thought you were doing the flying nun  sometimes we were come on help me figure out what to do pretty intense huh i hope ross didn t think we left because we were uncomfortable here i hope he did pheebs it s joey hey joey i saw someone that looks just like you on the subway i was going to say hi then i figured he doesn t care he looks like you that just cost me 4 bucks i called to see how the chick and the duck are doing they re having fun with aunt phoebe aunt rachel hasn t been helpful so do you miss me kind of but i ve been having too much fun you re not homesick yet i don t think so well the seven of us miss you  who s seven  me rachel the birds the babies the babies miss me pizza guy s here you ordered pizza without me but we were thinking about you we ordered the joey special two pizzas y i  gotta go talk to you later  wait where did you get it from y i and they re always glad you came y i you want to be where you can see y i your troubles are all the same y i you want to be where everybody knows your name why have you brought me here you ll see this wedding won t happen ross but imagine a lot more lights and fewer bricks and flowers and candles and the musicians can go over here the chairs can face this way and you go but if you don t love this we ll do it any other place or time really it s fine whatever you want it s perfect and i don t know if it rains then we ll get wet i don t even have a date do you remember where the duck food is in the guys apartment under the sink why because i m going to london what what do you mean i have to tell ross i love him take care and don t have the babies till i get back you can t go ross loves emily i know but i have to tell him how i feel he deserves all the information to make an informed decision you re going because you hope he ll say i love you too forget the british chippy you think he will no because he s in love with the british chippy you re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding it s too late you missed your chance i m sorry this must be hard but it s over no it s not over until someone says i do i do i do like i can really chase you i m carrying a litter the waltham residence is this emily s parents house y i this is the housekeeper and by the way that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone y i first one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak this is

girl s name you prissy old twit  way to suck up to the family  i m so glad you re all here my office finally got wrinklefree fax paper  the one where phoebe hates pbs  no no vomit tux  don t worry i had it drycleaned  vomit tux  who vomited on  you know what what you up to joe  they re doing this telethon thing on tv  and my agent got me a job as cohost  that s great  a little good deed for pbs plus some tv exposure  that s the kind of math joey likes to do  oh pbs   what s wrong with pbs  what s right with them  why don t you like pbs  right after my mom killed herself i was in a bad place personally  i thought i d write to sesame street   because they were nice when i was a little kid  no one ever wrote back  a lot of those muppets don t have thumbs  all i got was a lousy keychain and by that time i was living in a box  i didn t have keys  i m sorry pheebs  i wanted to do a good deed like you did with the babies  this isn t a good deed you just want to get on tv this is selfish  what about you having those babies for your brother  that s selfish  what are you talking about  it was a nice thing but it made you feel good right  yeah so  it made you feel good so that makes it selfish  look there s no unselfish good deeds sorry  yes there are totally good deeds that are selfless  may i ask for one example  yeah it s you know there s  no you may not  because all people are selfish  are you calling me selfish  are you calling you people  sorry to burst that bubble pheebs but selfless good deeds don t exist  you know the deal on santa claus  i ll find a selfless good deed i m going to beat you you evil genius  oh my god it s emily  it s emily everyone  i m only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives goodbye  you can hang up but i ll keep calling everyone in england  if that s what it takes to get you to talk to me  really about what  look you re my wife we re married  you know i love you  y i i really miss you  i miss you too  y i at least i think i do  she s talking  when you said the deal with santa you meant  that he doesn t exist  right  chandler have you heard about monica s secret boyfriend  yeah she might have mentioned him  so mon when are we going to meet this new secret waiter man  i don t think he s up to meeting everyone yet  yeah i don t think he s up to it  i want to meet this guy who s the best sex she ever had  really  that s what you heard you said that  i might have  why is that funny  because i m very happy for him  and you you lucky dog  she s willing to work on the relationship  that s great  in london  she wants me to move to london  but you live here 9945 you know that what will you do i bet if i talked to carol and susan i could convince them to move to london with ben i m sure your exwife would be more than happy to move so you can patch things up with your new wife it could happen how you doing welcome good to see you this ll be your phone that s great but i m not really expecting a lot of calls no you answer it and take pledges but i m the host gary collins is the host you ll be answering the phone you don t seem to understand i was dr drake ramoray well here s your phone doctor i can t believe i can t find a selfless good deed you know that old guy that lives next to me i snuck over there and raked up the leaves on his front stoop but he caught me and he forcefed me cider and cookies then i felt wonderful that old jackass maybe joey s right maybe all good deeds are selfish i will find a selfless good deed i gave birth to three children and i won t let them be raised in a world where joey s right can i ask you a cooking question if you re cooking on the stove that means your new boyfriend is better in bed than richard is he i think i ll respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend why if this guy was me and it s me who d learned that it was me who was the best you d ever had i d be like this y i all right emily as much as i love you i m sorry i can t move to london without ben i understand that would be difficult would you consider moving here you were moving here anyway y i why can t you just do that i don t know it s just but i know that even though i ve been a complete idiot up till now you have to come here y i you have to so we can y i work this out together all right did you just say all right i did now i m the idiot emily that is so great y i it ll be great we re going to be like two idiots in love there s one thing that really scares me still  yes tell me y i  you must understand how humiliating it was for me at the altar in front of my family and friends i know i am so sorry and then after deciding to forgive you seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her again very sorry i mean i can t be in the same room as her it drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her emily there is nothing between rachel and me y i i love you all right i ll come to new york and we ll try to make this work that s so great as long as you don t see rachel anymore i asked emily if she would come to new york and she said yes great only if i promise never to see rachel again what you can t what did you say i d think about it how am i supposed to make this decision i m actually asking you rachel is one of your best friends but emily s his wife that s true you can t just cut rachel out of your life that s true thanks for the help problem solved when will you be on tv there was kind of a mixup in my agent s office but i m still on tv and that s good exposure you re not on tv how about now there he is y i hello new york y i maybe just put the whole duck in there y i who cares y i now i got the legs how many times have i told you to never watch the cooking channel i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed that was yours we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars williamssonoma fall catalog page 27 expect it in 4 to 6 weeks joey s at the telethon for the rest of the day we have the place to ourselves yeah so maybe you d want to book some time with the best you ve ever had  you know what champ i think i ll pass why what s your point pbs telethon i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed i went down to the park and i let a bee sting me what good is that going to do it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends the bee is happy and i am definitely not you know the bee probably died after he stung you damn it back on in 30 seconds people excuse me would you mind switching with me no way i m in the shot man  you ve been here all day  i m taking pledges and we re on three two welcome back to our fall telethon if you ve been enjoying y i cirque du soleil and you d like to see more it s very simple all you have to do is call in a pledge and tell one of our volunteers what type of programming you that s it i cannot make this decision it is too difficult i leave it entirely up to the gods of fate a magic 8 ball you can t make this decision with a toy it s not a toy i don t know what else to do i either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends or i get divorced for the second time before i m 30 if anyone else has a better suggestion let s hear it because i got nothing don t be shy any suggestion will do okay then here we go magic 8 ball should i never see rachel again ask again later later is not good enough ask again later what the hell this is broken it is broken let me see will chandler have sex tonight don t count on it seems like it works to me pbs telethon y i hi joey hey pheebs i d like to make a pledge i would like to donate 200 two hundred dollars you sure after what sesame street did to you i m still mad at them but they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn t kill themselves by supporting them i m doing a good thing but i m not happy about it so there a selfless good deed you don t feel good about donating the money no it sucks i was saving up to buy a hamster a hamster those things are like 10 not the one i had my eye on y i it looks like we have surpassed y i last year s pledge total y i thank you y i and the pledge that did it y i was taken by one of our volunteers y i oh boy and may i say y i one of our sharpest dressed volunteers y i mr joseph tribbiani oh look joey s on tv isn t that great my pledge got joey on tv that makes me feel so oh no look i got carried away before but there s something you got to know if i m the best it s only because you made me the best keep talking i was nothing before you call the other girls and ask which wouldn t take long but when i m with you and we re together oh my god oh my god i understand if you never want to sleep with me again but that d be wrong we re too good we owe it to sex if we owe it oh my when will joey be home i was kind of hoping we could do this without him no no no leave the gloves on i cleaned the bathroom why don t we lose the gloves all right let s show them how it s done  that wasn t part of it  i know you ready we re going to be late

totally stop pinching me you guys said to keep my mouth shut if ross was happy right he just told me that he s not entirely happy what s going on we all hate emily no ross we do not hate emily we just think that you re having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy we just think that maybe she s being a little unreasonable yes unreasonable unreasonable how about we have this conversation when one of you marries you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work it s compromise do you always like it no do you do it yes because it s not all laughing happy candy in the sky coffee at

given but yes anyone else symbolism and the wildness of the moors which i think is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff s character excellent what rachel has shrewdly observed here you completely stole my answer honey that was pretty obvious how would you know you didn t read it what do you think you in the blue shirt i think that yours is a question with many possible answers would you care to venture one would you care to venture one are you just repeating me are you just repeating me all right let s move on okay then why didn t you say you hadn t read the book i didn t want him to think i was stupid that was really embarrassing what happened to you your note amazing not only did no one touch my sandwich but people at work are actually afraid of me a guy called me mental  mental geller i ve always wanted a cool nickname like that the best you got in high school was wet pants geller  it was the water fountain okay  anyway people are writing reports for me pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule i tell you you get tough with people and you can get anything you want hey tribbiani give me that coffee now this was really fun i ve been wondering if you d ask me out so

promised to be more careful the good joey name s been dragged through the mud we re so sorry i m telling everyone it s the only explanation that doesn t make me look like a pig no there s a better explanation tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class i like that but no how does that explain my underwear at your place i don t know get ready to come out of the nongay closet i promise to come up with something just give us time all right but it better make me look really good and another thing the video camera nice may i have a word of course donald we ve been getting reports of very angry behavior on your part threatening letters refusal to meet deadlines apparently people now call you mental we want you to speak to a psychiatrist you don t understand this is so silly this is all just because of a sandwich a sandwich you see my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches her secret is she puts an extra slice of gravysoaked bread in the middle i call it the moistmaker  anyway i put my sandwich in the fridge oh you know what i m sorry i believe i ate that you ate my sandwich a simple mistake it can happen to anyone oh really did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moistmaker do you perhaps remember seeing a note on top of it there may have been a joke or limerick of some kind that said it was my sandwich now calm down look in my office some may be in the trash it was quite large i had to throw most of it away you threw my sandwich away y i my sandwich  what s this book about you didn t read it either i was going to but i accidentally read something else y i vogue so tell me about jane eyre no read it yourself come on don t be such a goodygoody fine all right so jane eyre first you d think she s a woman but she s not she s a cyborg a cyborg isn t that like a robot this book was light years ahead of its time sorry i m late let s get started what did you think of jane eyre rachel and i were discussing it and she had very interesting insights go ahead rachel thank you phoebe what struck me most when reading jane eyre  was how the book was so ahead of its time if you re talking about feminism i think you re right well feminism yes but also the robots since that video camera thing didn t work out i thought that i would give you just a little preview you re naked i know are you okay i m fine i saw a psychiatrist at work today why on account of my rage which if i may say right now is out of control he gave me a pill for it a pill when the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again so he offered me a tranquilizer and i thought it was a good idea so i took it they re making you take time off work and you re okay with that i don t know it s going to be weird not having a job for a while but i definitely don t care about my sandwich it s so embarrassing i can t believe you let me go on like that i m sorry it was so funny when you compared jane eyre to robocop  that was not funny i snapped okay you weren t taking the class seriously come on what is the big deal i thought it d be something we could do together i thought it would be fun fun is good but i also wanted to learn people talk about what they learned in high school i never went so you really wanted to learn you know pheebs i just wanted to have fun you know who should go i know i know i know monica you asked the question oh my god that s monica you get away from me you sick sick sicko what s going on joey has got a secret peephole he has a naked picture of monica he takes naked pictures of us then he eats chicken and looks at them oh dude that s my sister give me that wait everybody calm down okay let s give our friend a chance to explain why he s such a big pervert i am not a pervert okay it s just i just kind of i think i can explain this thank you joey s a sex addict what  no i m not it s okay it s good it s a disease i am not a sex addict yes you are that s the only way to explain all this stuff no it isn t it s not because you could also explain it with the truth what is the truth  what s up  what s going on i slept with monica well let s see what everybody thinks of that you slept with my sister yes but it was we just did it once in london this is not good for my rage is this true of course it s true how else would you explain all the weird stuff that s been going on yes it s true if it happened once how come we found your underwear in our apartment that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london right monica i guess i wanted to keep it as a souvenir my god monica are you sure you re not just a sex addict if anyone s a sex addict here it s monica she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london that s why she gave you a naked picture of herself that makes sense and the video camera i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey but sadly i could not be enticed unbelievable you really kept joey s underwear why why would you do that i m monica i m disgusting i stalk guys and keep their underpants i think we ve all learned who s disgusting and who s not now i m going to get back to

right now are you going to this is a disaster can t i please just go i m talking you up to people give it some time relax get something to eat what did you tell them about me i told them about you and emily trying to get some sympathy but you came off as the bad guy i told it wrong we should talk about that because i don t understand what happened there this cake is really good things are looking up oh my god someone cut howard s cake who would do a thing like that 3b you got your free food you ruined everyone s fun isn t it time you went home go back to 3b 3b everyone calm down i have something that i d like to say who here likes ross of course you don t like him he didn t give you any money he raised his own hand when i asked who likes ross and he s wearing two name tags i ll be honest when i first met ross i didn t like him at all once i got to know him i saw that he is really sweet and caring and very generous all i m saying is don t judge ross before you get to know him you know i like all of you guys now but when i first met you you know kurt i thought abrasive drunk lola mindnumbingly stupid you guys gold digger cradlerobbing perv so i think you all know what i mean obviously i didn t think they would throw things i thought if i kept insulting them you d defend them then you d look like the hero see i did not get that where s monica i need to talk to her it s urgent i m monica i need to talk to you it s urgent i ve been thinking about us a lot of us thinking i guess there s only one way to do this what are you doing don t do it will you marry me what a bad idea i can t not look at it why are you doing this i don t know but i know i m not afraid to do this i m doing this because i m sorry do you think the best reason to get married is because you re sorry the best reason is pregnancy sorry is fourth behind being ready and actually wanting to get married will you be my wife i want you to take a minute and think about how ridiculous this sounds i m kind of wishing everyone wasn t here now none of that came from me i never said i wanted to have babies and get married i was really confused then i talked to these guys who two divorces and joey she s right you know yeah but still cheap shot you know when i said that i want you to deal with relationship stuff all on your own you re not ready i didn t think i was oh my god what would you have done if i had said yes i would ve been happy because i would spend the rest of my life with the woman i love or you would have seen a chandlershaped hole in that door will you pass that knife no i will not you don t have to be mean about it you re right i m sorry will you marry me i was going to ask you to marry me because i didn t say hello to you or ask them to move in with you but i m not sure chandler how long is this going to go on i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so a long time this is fun remember that we were on a break thing i m sorry will you marry me that s not funny

cranking anything up i ll treat you real nice yeah well you know i think it s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date but the way you do it is you meet someone become their friend

funny  anyway we were saying goodbye and 9993 what happened we were shaking hands y i  and he leaned in toward me y i maybe he was opening the door y i  but i totally y i misread him and i you kissed him i didn t know what else to do you could have tried not kissing him thanks chandler a guy from ralph lauren called you got a second interview i can t believe it i got a second interview that kiss

let s bring back the girl who kisses everybody come on rach what if he thinks i ll just sleep with him he wants you back because you re right for the job maybe i don t know oh god how could i be so

sleep around to get ahead even though i kissed you that does not give you the right to demand sex from me i do not want this job that bad good day sir you are not gonna believe what that sleazeball from ralph lauren did to me okay that s amazing how did you know that you got ink on your lip what do you say maybe sometime i hold your gun we re not supposed to do that what could happen i mean yeah i m gonna say no  do you want to see a movie tonight  we can t we already have plans what are you doing well same thing we did all day just hang out at gary s apartment he is so amazing we never left the bedroom but have fun at the movie well we re not seeing a movie then why did you ask us if we wanted to go because i just wanted to know what you were doing so you wouldn t walk in on me and chandler while we were doing it all night will you excuse me chandler can i see you for a second  we have got to beat them  why because gary and phoebe think they re a hotter couple than us so so we ve gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong you ve got to stop this competitive thing it s crazy just to impress them you want us to have sex over and over and i m saying no to this why get your coat excuse me you should check this out tell the other tenants apparently he s looking for some kind of hot girl who isn t i don t think we ve met i m ross i know you re the guy who wouldn t chip in for the handyman never mind i actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted i mean you had just moved in i had just moved in thank you listen jen i know this may sound a little but would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime sure that would be nice my number s on there give me a call i will give you a call  i ll see you later  okay i forgot my paper that was amazing phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner that was amazing we are the hottest huh no one is hotter than we are  we re the best  no you re the best  no you re the best  no you re the best i am the best hey guys what you been doing isn t that the girl who waved at you i don t know but i can see through your sheet yeah that s her you know it doesn t matter i ll never meet her it s impossible to find her apartment she lives in some hotgirl parallel universe or something what are you talking about she lives on the 2nd floor 7th apartment from the left no she lives on the 3rd floor 8th apartment from the left no those first two windows that s the lobby that other window is the stairway you ve been counting wrong i did not know that thank you monica i almost lost another girl because of counting  so you ready  yeah i ll just get my coat  could you get that  sure no no first i would like to say thank you for seeing me again that s all right but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped well first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and for yelling at you fair enough now you re probably going to hire one of the people who did not yell at you and storm out and i think that s a big mistake and here s why i made a huge fool of myself and i came back that shows courage when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job i said no that shows integrity and i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage now i know that i ve already said courage but you ve got to have courage and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances i said no and i was not litigious so there you go you got courage you got integrity you got courage again and not litigious look mr zelner i knew that oh i knew that i really really want this job and i think i would be really good at it you know what i may regret this but i ll give you a shot you are really thank you oh god would it be inappropriate if i gave you a hug well how about a handshake oh god i m sorry i did not mean to touch that i mean you there i m gonna leave thank you very much hey i ll see you monday are you tired you better believe he s tired after the day we had if you know what i mean do you know what i mean honey the tortilla chips know what you mean do you like that badge i got you oh yeah it s so cool now i gotta go officer bing s got a 10100 that s peepee phoebe you have a twig in your hair we kind of took a detour on our way over here we were strolling through the park and no one was around so  you didn t  we did we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code the park huh public place i hear you can you excuse me for a second hi chandler monica this is the men s room isn t it yes it is but see i ve always found the men s bathroom very sexual haven t you no and if i did i don t think we d be going out this is getting ridiculous come on we can t let them win we ve proved that we are hot okay so why are you obsessed about this phoebe and gary are in that  can t keep their hands off each other phase so it makes me really sad that we re not really there anymore oh is that what this has all been about wasn t it a lot more exciting when we were all over each other all the time yeah that was great that was really great but the truth is i m more excited about where we are now  really  yeah i ve never been in a relationship this long before to get past the beginning and still want to be around each other i think that s incredible and the fact that this is happening with you i think that s pretty exciting that s so sweet i know that i was acting a little crazy but i feel the same way you know what i just realized you just freaked out about our relationship  i did not  yes you did admit it you freaked out i freaked out a little a little you freaked out bigtime okay and i fixed it we have switched places i am the relationship king and you are the crazy irrational screwup and now we re back i cannot believe ross is buying this thank god i can t watch him anymore you guys ready by the way thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine man they cannot get enough

get me some shirts  i don t know if i d feel comfortable stealing on my very first day  unwilling to steal from work  interesting  if anybody gets free stuff it s me  okay guys way to wish me luck  go get em  let s discuss rachel s birthday  i say we throw a surprise party this weekend  but her birthday s not for another month  if we throw a party on her birthday it s not a surprise  great we can

girlfriend  so i gotta shut it down now  i gotta go i m picking up ben  and then we re off to the big audition  it ll be weird seeing some actor pretending to be ben s dad  weirder than his two moms making out  dad there s a dad in the commercial  yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it  maybe i ll go with you and audition as the dad  who better to play ben s dad than his godfather   you re not his godfather  what  are you kidding  of course i am   okay let s go godfather  all right  they ll let me audition  really that s great  one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play  so i steered clear of her   that kid looks familiar  oh yeah  he s done tons of commercials sugar smacks playstation  and for the phone company  he was so good he convinced me to switch phone companies  chandler was mad  he s not gonna get this one ben is way cuter than that kid  i mean look at him  that s great  wouldn t it be great if i got to play ben s dad  you look nothing like ben  i look more like him than you do  i really don t know you well enough for you to do that  so it s down to these two nancy i know you like this one  i think i agree rachel what do you think  well that one is pretty  but i just love this fabric  sorry  don t be part of your job is to give your opinions  then i take credit for them i m kidding  she is kidding but don t ever disagree with her again  okay now i m kidding  what a fun office  i don t know which one but i do know i need a cigarette  let s take a break go outside and sort this out when we return   you smoke  no  my dad s a doctor and he would always tell me horror stories  about ghosts and goblins  who totally supported the princess s right to smoke  then they came back from smoking and they d made all of the decisions   that s not fair  i know  it s like i m being punished for not having this disgusting habit  yeah it is the best  what if this keeps happening  they ll be smoking making the decisions  and i ll be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air  and when kim wants to promote one of us  who do you think she ll pick me or smokey smokerson  you can go down there and not smoke say you want some fresh air  i could do that  or you could do the easy thing and smoke  do you wanna go get coffee   i would love to  oh good  i m gonna go too  oh good  oh i changed my mind  let s talk about the party i have so many ideas  me too 9998 oh look at that this is a little sketch of the cake see some sample menus i thought we d start with a tuscanstyle finger food and for music here s an alphabetized list of all of my cds i ve highlighted the ones that ll go with the food  what about the dinner party  we re not doing that looks like you took care of everything thanks a lot cohost wait a minute there s plenty

excited about it that s great you are the best excuse me can i bum one of those actually this one s what s so funny over here i thought you didn t smoke you know i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes you know what i mean doobies actually i thought to myself those guys are crazy but no i smoke the regular ones all the time we get high me too i m kidding me too oh god this is so nerveracking how do you do this fortunately i don t get many callbacks so is it a good sign that they asked us to wait who knows we have narrowed it down to raymond ben kyle and joey the rest of you thank you yes i knew it byebye so long later this is great i might get to play ben s dad that can t happen because you have such different looks we re putting you with raymond and kyle with ben so it ll either be you two or you two  this is gonna be kind of weird  yeah it is yeah it s gonna be weird no we re like best friends that s why it s weird i thought we were just talking is it okay if i leave this here till rachel s birthday party  sure what s in them  cups good because we got rachel 800 gallons of water that s a lot of cups i m in charge of cups and ice and monica s gonna rue the day she put me in charge of cups and ice you know i rued the day once didn t get a whole lot else done okay time to bring up the rest of the cups ross i m glad you re here  i want to talk to you  what s up i ve been thinking about this commercial thing me against ben the two of us competing that can t lead to anything good i think i m just gonna step aside i ll tell them that i won t audition joey that s great thanks man that s it you re gonna let me do this it s my career we re talking about but you just i said that so you wouldn t let ben do it if anyone should step aside it should be ben  what  chandler tell him well let me get the door first hi no one why should ben step aside it was his audition in the first place you tagged along you re like the tagalong dad i care about his feelings what you know how hard it ll be on him when he doesn t get it and why wouldn t he get it come on have you seen what my kid can do he dials phones he eats tortilla chips he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid you just give him a spoon baby oh yeah i guess we ll see this commercial belongs to me and mitch  your kid s name is raymond  yeah so is yours  how did work go  it was great i went down there like you said and we talked business and kim took my opinions you stink  thanks  no i m serious because i went down and they were smoking this is actually the smell of success but there s something different oh my god you smoked i did not yes you did you look happy and sick you smoked all right fine but i had to i had to do it for my career i wish i had to smoke for my career that s so gross it s not that bad you know yeah my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell i actually feel like i could throw up but

are call me tonight y i okay bye no i know thank god you were here we have to erase that what we can t do that we have to what if ross hears that and calls her and they get back together is that what you want ross back with that controlling neurotic crazy emily who wouldn t let him see you no oh no no god no he should not get back with her i know that you know that even ross knows that but we have no right to erase his message look i m his sister and i love him i don t want to see him get hurt doesn t that give me the right to control help him he s not the one who needs help she s obviously unstable she s thinking about running out on her wedding day okay fine but look at the position she s putting him in and what s he gonna do break up their marriage on their wedding day who would do that okay fine all right but that was different although it did involve a lot of the same people this is some twisted joke she s playing on him you are crazy she sounded genuinely upset i mean listen y i your messages have been erased no okay but we re safe right nothing bad s gonna go down no but that reminds me sign this what is it it says you can t sue if you scrape your knee or get your head blown off oh hurry up i want to sign that here he comes what is he doing what the hell is he doing what is it  is everything okay  what he sees us don t move and don t look at him hey it s okay it was just a car backfire hey look at that you tried to save your buddy you see that you see what he did you okay man thanks joey hello we should go no wait oh yeah right no monica monica we have to fix this what can we do you erased the message unless we tell him if you want to be rational i can t argue with you all right fine tell him i just don t want to be a part of it maybe that s emily leaving the exact same message y i hey ross it s you i just y i want you to remember this feeling y i you are lucky to be alive y i so live every day to the fullest y i love yourself okay y i and also get stamps bye play that message for emily and this problem goes away right anybody want to meet a hero john glenn is here no joey we had the most incredible night  we re in the car  wait hold on hi okay go ahead so we re in the car and bang a shot was fired and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me my god it was a car backfire but he didn t know that yeah i didn t know that it could just as easily have been a bullet ever think about joining the force we could use a guy like you who jumps at loud noises wow i could have died tonight if the car that backfired had run over you i m going before he starts rambling about his newfound respect for life i do have a newfound respect for life oh my god  you want to get some dinner  yeah sure you know what if i heard a shot right now i d throw my body on you maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood okay bye cut it out i d hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day why d you take off just going for a walk around the living room whatever  is something wrong  no no i m just tired you know from the walk you dove in front of ross ross that s what this is about oh my god you hate ross i don t hate ross of course you do i saved him you re mad at me it adds up you want ross out of the picture what picture i don t know but i don t like what i m hearing i m glad you saved ross but it could ve been a bullet and you didn t try to save me you re upset because you think i chose ross over you no i knew you could take care of yourself you know i mean ross needs help he s not street like us you d risk your life for ross before you would for me that s the bottom line no not exactly all right look i wasn t trying to save ross okay my sandwich was next to ross all right i was trying to save my sandwich from a bullet  i know it doesn t make much sense  much sense look it was instinct i just went for it you risked your life for a sandwich i know it sounds crazy but this is the greatest sandwich in the world so you didn t choose ross before me no i would never do that you re like my brother  really  yeah in fact to prove how much you mean to me here  thanks  easy it s not a hot dog how good is that see what are you doing you re showing me how much i mean to you with a bite jeez what are you doing here hey you know what you are in our apartment all the time this is just a drop in the bucket mister it doesn t matter the important thing is that you re here you re my friend and you re here okay just a little scared what s going on the most amazing thing happened tonight i thought my number was up i had an actual neardeath experience what happened we were on the ridealong with gary and somebody took a shot at me really no a car backfired but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me and rach i survived and i was filled with this great respect for life i want to experience every moment i want to seize every opportunity i am seeing everything so clearly now because a car backfired okay why are you here i don t know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but emily called you today  you talked to her  she left a message but it kind of got erased i mean there s something wrong with your machine what did she say something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and she wants you to call her wow that was a good thing that i told you right yeah yes of course okay thank you thank you because i m gonna tell monica i was right because she didn t want not important point is i was right your decision okay i was right your decision right i guess i should call emily no that s not the right decision that s not right ross come on i mean that woman made you miserable do you really want to get back into that okay look yesterday i wouldn t have even considered calling her back but my exwife calls on the same day i have a neardeath experience that s gotta mean something that was not a neardeath experience that was barely an experience you weren t there maybe this is something that i m supposed to seize you know okay you know what maybe this is not about seizing stuff maybe this is about escaping stuff okay look at today i mean you escaped death and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily that does make sense because i do want to seize some opportunity but i really don t want to see or talk to her well there you go yeah maybe today s just closecall day hey thanks rach oh honey no problem wait wait the message is blinking maybe you didn t erase it y i hey ross it s you that s an old message nobody needs to hear that hey was monica here i want my money back you probably need that for stamps right has gary ever been shot at for real yes once a little he kind of did it to himself it s not really a good story i wonder how i d react under fire and not backfire but heavy fire like if i was in a war man i would be great in a war i think i d make a fantastic military leader i mean i know i d make general before any of you guys before or after you were shot by your own troops i know joey would be in the foxhole protecting all of us if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches yeah hero sandwiches you all know i m a pacifist so i m not interested in war in any way but when the revolution comes i ll have to destroy you all not you joey

s absolutely no rush  12   okay  12   don t you want a cookie  12   sure  12   thanks  12   do you need a tissue  12   where did you get these i made them  12   oh god they re so yummy  13   it s gonna be weird when i come home and you re not here  13   no more joey and chan s  13   no more j and c s  13   want to go to joey and chandler s can t it s not there  13   i ll be across the hall we can still do all the same stuff  13   we won t be able to have those long talks at night    13     about our feelings and the future  13   not once did we do that  13   i told rachel that it s just gonna be the two of us  13   oh yeah well how d she take it  13   really well  13   surprisingly well  13   she didn t cry she wasn t angry or sad  13   and you re upset because you didn t make your best friend cry  13   all i m asking for is a little emotion  13   is that too much to ask after six years  13   what are rachel and i not as close as you guys  13   i mean did we not have as much fun don t i deserve a few tears  14   when we told joey he cried his eyes out  14   i did not cry my eyes out  14   come on it s like the end of an era  14   no more jman and channy s  14   okay i gotta ask who calls us that  14   you got married again  14   yes  14   so that s your second marriage in two years  14   yes second in two years  14   third overall  14   i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years    14     and never have i had so much business from one client  14   why don t you tell me what happened  14   basically rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk  14   i m sorry is this the same rachel whose name you said    14     at the altar in the second marriage  15   yes yes yes  15   but i do not love her  15   that s better then  15   this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled  15   i see  15   have you considered therapy  15   i think just the annulment for today  15   there are some forms to fill out easy  15   we ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind  15   no problem  15   we ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge  15   there s no way to do this without her  15   because i kind of already told her it was taken care of  15   of course you did  15   look you can t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there  15   what about someone who looks like rachel  15   i will think about the therapy  16   so i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff  16   okay  16   no point in dragging it out  16   dragging out the long process of you moving out    16     and us not living together anymore  16   what about this who gets this  16   i don t know if i want it because it might be too many memories  16   what is that i don t know  16   how about this i want you to have the big plate  16   wow monica thanks i love this plate  16   something to remember me by  16   mon you re not dying i m just moving out  16   we re gonna see each other all the time  16   but still it s a big change  17   the end of an era you might say  17   are you okay you re not blinking  17   i m fine i was thinking about how it s an end of an era  17   oh all right  17   but i gotta say i don t think six years counts as an era  17   an era is defined as a significant period of time  17   it was significant for me maybe it wasn t significant to you  17   what is the matter with you what is the matter with you   17   why aren t you more upset  17   aren t you gonna be sad that we re not living together  17   aren t you gonna miss me at all  17   monica all right but don t get mad at me  17   it s just a little hard to believe  17   what s hard to believe  17   i mean it s you guys you do this kind of stuff you know  17   you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out  17   i m not upset because i don t see you going through with it i m sorry  18   it s going to happen  18   chandler will move in here  18   but l i know just let me finish okay  18   this isn t something that we just impulsively decided to do in vegas  18   this is something that we both really want  18   and it is going to happen  18   it is  18   really  18   yeah sweetie  18   you mean we re not gonna live together anymore  18   oh my god i m gonna miss you so much  18   i m gonna miss you  18   i mean it s the end of an era  18   i know  18   okay bye oh no  18   so did you get the annulment  19   i couldn t  19   i knew it because you love rachel  19   it s not that annulments are more complicated  19   complicated because of the love  19   i do not love rachel  19   i m telling her about the whole thing    19     so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible  19   would i do that if i loved her  19   i ve never been more convinced of your love for her  19   i do not have feelings for rachel okay  19   oh what s wrong  19   monica and chandler are moving in here    19     and i have to move out and everything is changing  19   oh my god come here come here it s okay  19   everything s gonna be okay  19   thank you  19   of course  19   so ross and rachel got married  20   monica and chandler almost got married  20   you think we should hook up  20   oh we do  20   but not just yet  20   really well when  20   well first chandler and monica will get married    20     and be filthy rich by the way  20   but it won t work out  20   i know  20   then i ll marry chandler for the money  20   and you ll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids  20   great  20   but then we ditch them and we get married  20   we ll have chandler s money and rachel s kids  20   getting custody will be easy because of rachel s drinking problem  20   what about ross  20   i don t want to go into the whole thing  20   but we have words and i kill him     200

 6x03 - The One With Ross's Denial.,check it out this is unbelievable joey s been holding his breath for almost four minutes you trying to kill me i want to ask you something since i m moving out and you re so beautiful     how about i move in with you that would be great but what do we do about denise who s denise my roommate your roommate  00   yes denise denise 1what is with the secrecy phoebe 1what about denise she cute 1how can you have a roommate that we don t know about 1because you never listen to what i say 1i talk about her all the time denise 1i m gonna have an extra room over at my place 1that s true  00   move in with me we can stay up late talking and watch movies  01   you know about naked thursdays right  01   yeah yeah i think i ll find my own place  01   hey i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man  01   the one with ross denial  01   english subtitles by gelula sdi  01   what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her  01   oh that  01   she took it really well  02   you didn t tell her did you no  02   because you re in love with her  02   i am not in love with her she was upset about having to move out  02   if she knew we were still married she d have been more upset  02   so i comforted her as a friend  02   you comforted her  02   nothing i just gave her a hug  02   a classic sign of love the hug  02   it s also a sign of friendship  02   not in your case lovey loverson  02   it was a hug  02   did you or did you not smell her hair  02   smell her hair  02   what if i did  02   ninety percent of a woman s pheromones come out of her head  02   that s why women are shorter  02   so that men will fall in love when they hug them  02   come on ross you re a scientist  02   i was hugging her as a friend  02   it s not my fault her hair got in my face  02   she s got a lot of it and it smells all  all    02     coconutty  03   what it doesn t mean i have feelings for rachel  03   maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts  03   okay but be careful rachel s not in the same place you are  03   if the place you re referring to is being in love    03     she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place  03   i didn t understand that  03   maybe that s because you were speaking the secret language of love  03   a guy just called for you who was it  03   i don t know how about thanks for taking the message  03   when you move in    03     rachel s room will be empty let s talk about what to do with it  03   i think we should have a beautiful guest room    03     with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with fresh flowers  03   and comment cards so people could tell us how great their stay was  04   i really haven t thought about it that much  04   well i like that idea  obviously  04   i was thinking maybe   maybe it could be a game room  04   you can buy old arcade games like space lnvaders and asteroids    04     for 200 the real ones the big big big ones  04   no  04   you mean no as in  04   what an interesting idea let s discuss it before we reject it  04   i m sorry  04   interesting idea but no  04   so that s it  04   i just don t think arcade games go in a beautiful guest room    04     filled with antiques  04   which is why asteroids is perfect it s the oldest game  04   what s wrong with a beautiful guest room  04   i m not against it  04   especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away  04   are you mocking me  05   no i m not mocking you or your beautiful guest room  05   monica and i had a stupid fight  05   you re still moving in together right my ad came out today  05   wanted female roommate nonsmoker nonugly  05   nice  05   i figured it d be more interesting to have a female roommate  05   someone i could

roommate denise  08   she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her  08   he said he didn t love her but he really did and it just blew up  08   and that s how she ended up living with me

the room together  09   great idea we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room  09   totally  09   we don t have to decide now good  09   let s think about changes we can make in the living room  09   changes  09   we ll have to move some furniture to make room for my chair  09   you re bringing the barcalounger over here  10   is that a problem  10   it s just that they re a set and should stay together  10   that s cool i ll bring them both over  10   you re taking them away from their home  10   i get it i get nothing nothing here is mine everything is yours  10   i ll get up in the morning put on your clothes and go off to work  10   yeah that s it everything will be mine nothing will be yours  10   i m talking about the barcalounger  10   it doesn t match where will it go  10   in the game room  10   it is not my fault your chairs are incredibly ugly  10   that s fine  10   i won t bring the chairs i won t bring anything  10   i wouldn t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma s place  10   everything on your application looks really good  10   just one last question  10   will your friends be over here partying and hanging out  10   don t worry i m not a party girl  10   don t just be blurting stuff out  10   i want you to really think about your answers  11   call off the roommate search hi i ll be living here  11   ignore him he s just some guy who wants the apartment  11   but he s not going to get it  11   you took down the shower curtain  11   that thing was a hazard  11   i m very safety conscious  11   i was just clearing some space for your stuff  11   thanks  11   but listen monica and chandler had a big fight and they re not moving in  11   what do you mean not moving in they re still moving in right  11   no they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room  11   over a stupid room  11   i feel kind of bad for them but now i don t have to move in here  11   oh no yeah that part s great  11   what s all this about you guys fighting  12   is this really over a room  12   that is so silly  12   we can handle this  12   apparently not  12   and i can t stand by and watch two people i care about so much    12     be hurt by something that is so silly  12   enough of the silliness  12   tell her to stop being silly  12   two very good points  12   i ve known you both a long time  12   and i ve never seen either of you onemillionth as happy    12     as you ve been since you got together  12   do you really want to throw that all away over a room  12   that is so silly  12   what s more important love    12     or silliness  12   well we are fond of the silliness  13   but we also have a soft spot for the love  13   love is the best medicine that s iaughter  13   why do you do it i don t know  13   now chandler you want to live with monica right  13   yeah i do  13   and mon you want to live with chandler  13   yes  13   a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york  13   so i understand you re looking for a place  13   no i m staying put  13   i was going to offer you my apartment  13   why where you going  13   i don t know  13   you won t believe it  14   monica and chandler are moving in again  14   that s great news right i mean for them right  14   but on the bright side we get to be roommates again  14   yeah you know about that     14   i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything    14     but don t you think it ll be weird  14   why why would it    why would it be weird  14   well you know because of us  14   because of our history  14   no  14   no no  14   it would only be weird if we were still in that place  14   are you still in that place  14   no not at all  14   good me neither  14   so it s not a problem  14   we re just two friends who happen to be roommates  14   okay but eventually you and i will be dating  15   really we are  15   yeah i ll have a boyfriend and you ll have a girlfriend  15   that d be great  15   but if you think it ll be okay we ll just work out a system  15   it ll be like in college i ll hang a sign on the door  15   come back later i m getting lucky  15   yeah i didn t think of that  15   so are you sure about this whole movingin thing  15   it s a really big step and what s the rush  15   that s very funny  15   he s being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness  15   no i m serious think about it you move in  15   you start fighting over game rooms next thing you know you break up  15   it was just a stupid fight about a room  16   there are no stupid fights  16   this isn t about the room  16   this is about what the room represents  16   and unfortunately this room could destroy you  16   i m not so worried me neither  16   fine it s your life  16   i just don t want to see you break up  16   which you will do if you move in together  16   but if that s what you want there s nothing i can do  16   don t do it  16   you still want to move in together of course  16   ross didn t

do more than that he can destroy the universe  08   they could swallow one of those little parts  08   also look at his smooth area that s just gonna mess them up  09   they won t swallow anything you re too overprotective  09   when i was a kid my mom used to throw me into a pile of broken glass  09   what glass sand whatever  09   look at little leslie stretching in her sleep  09   oh it s so cute  09   i wonder when you stop putting both legs behind your head  09   i can still do that  09   how are you still single  09   i thought about it and maybe you re right maybe krog is not a safe toy  09   what made you change your mind i swallowed his sonic blaster gun  09   how did that happen  09   i was trying to prove that i was right  09   and it turns out i was wrong    09     and now it s lodged in my throat  09   this whole time we were concentrating on the babies    09     and no one was watching chandler  10   you are asking the court for an annulment  10   yes your honor here are our forms all filled out  10   so based on your petition    10     you are seeking an annulment on the grounds    10     that mr geller is mentally unstable  10   fine i m mentally unstable  10   and based on the fact that mr geller is an intravenous drug user  10   what yes heroin and crack  10   crack isn t even an intravenous drug  10   well you would know  10   now it also says here that you    10      iied about your sexual preference before marriage  10   oh come on  10   ross please i found the magazines  10   and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage  10   well that makes sense since you re gay and addicted to heroin  10   you know i m sorry this is insane  10   i m not addicted to heroin i m not gay and there is no problem    11     with my ability to consummate anything  11   i ll consummate this marriage right here right now  11   that won t be necessary  11   and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies  11   if you were involved in a serious relationship that creates a problem  11   rest assured that relationship ended two years ago  11   strike consummated like bunnies from the record  11   is there anything in this record that is actually true  11   well yes we got married in vegas  11   and the names i think  11   based on what i ve heard you certainly don t qualify for an annulment  11   if you don t wanna be together file for divorce  11   that s great you happy look what you did with your funny funny form  11   what me what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense  11   and what  11   what are you typing that for she said we don t get the annulment  11   don t type that what  12   stop typing  12   stop typing  12   stop typing stop typing  12   okay do you see what you re keeping me married to  12   get out of my chambers  12   lady here s the deal  12   i came here for an annulment and i m not leaving here until i get one  12   would you like a night in jail thank you for your time  12   that porsche guy took his car back  12   but you found the keys to his clothes  12   no i just love the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche  12   they ll think you own one because of the clothes  13   of course  13   only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn t have the car  13   that is true  13   yeah but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun  13   oh i ve been there  13   i am gonna go drive my porsche  13   you know you don t actually have one  13   what are you doing i m in character will you talk to her  13   i think it just moved it s poking me  13   we

re playing a zone they ll tripleteam me  13   he s got plastic in his throat we gotta go to the hospital  13   but a doctor won t be able to help him and it s just gonna    13     naturally pass through his system in seven years  14   i think that s gum i m pretty sure it s gun  14   this really hurts let s go  14   but no a real man wouldn t just run to the hospital  14   no what would krog do  14   why isn t that valet back with my porsche  14   maybe because you ve got the keys  14   that was totally your fault my fault you threatened the judge  14   you ripped the paper out of the court reporter s machine  14   that was the only way i could get him to stop typing  14   hi how are the gellers  14   don t call us that  14   the judge wouldn t let us get an annulment now we gotta

thought it d be funny to eat a lot of grapes  18   and i thought it would be funnier if we got married  18   so as a compromise we decided first to get married and then    19     to eat a lot of grapes  19   sorry i got us into this whole thing  19   so then if you think about it    19     this is all your fault  19   yeah don t push it though  19   i gotta say    19     i know i divorce a lot of women  19   never thought i d be divorcing you  19   i know  19   i always thought if we got married that d be the one that stuck  19   and it wouldn t be a secret    19     and we wouldn t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut  19   did i even treat  19   no it was on the house it was a newlywed special  19   that may be the most depressing thing i ve heard  20   i should get these to my lawyer s office  20   thanks for taking care of all this  20   no problem  20   i m gonna need a copy of those totally  20   careful around my porsche  20   hi joey  20   hey how you doing  20   he

you walked up to that girl you liked and talked    12     about the lrish potato famine  12   what about you you weren t so hot either  12   after everything he said he d go  12   monica doesn t like that either i should stop doing that  12   girls don t like it when i start talking about science  12   that s not specific to girls  12   this is great what else  12   they don t like you correcting their grammar  12   and they don t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny  12   they don t like it when you keep asking them if they like you  12   man i am so lucky i have monica i m never gonna find love again  12   can i talk to you for a second sure  13   phoebe i just wanted to say i m sorry okay  13   i handled the situation horribly  13   and i should not have lied to you  13   so what should you have done  13   i should have told you the truth  13   which is  13   well the reason i didn t want to go running with you is    13     because    13     the way that you run is just a little     13   so it s embarrassing  13   people were looking at us like we were crazy  13   why do you care because they re people  13   people you don t know and will never see again  13   yes but still they are people    13     with eyes  13   i didn t get embarrassed running next to miss     13   but okay  13   i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you  13   okay you re uptight  14   what i am not uptight  14   i am not uptight man  14   that s okay i m not judging you that s just who you are  14   i m more free you know i run like i did when i was a kid    14     because that s the only way it s fun you know  14   didn t you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off    14     iike when you were running towards the swings or running away from satan  14   the neighbor s dog  14   is this in the right place  14   who cares i repel women  14   you can t come in here  14   ross is naked  14   i couldn t say i was naked because she s allowed to see me naked  14   why does anyone have to be naked  15   why is ross naked  15   i had to show chandler something  15   naked  15   i guess i have    15     a guy problem  15   is it the same thing chandler

 i m lovable  16   clearly there s a vibe going on between us  16   but we re roommates    16     and it s a huge mistake for us to continue down this road  16   imagine living in a supermarket    16     and you ll understand  17   okay so the question is what do we do  17   there isn t anything to do  17   i think you re really sweet  17   but i m not interested in you like that  17   no i mean

was so brave and so strong  06   and it s making me look at him totally differently  06   he used to be just jack geller monica and ross dad  06   now he s jack geller dream hunk  06   i don t know to me he ll always be jack geller    06     walks in while you re changing  06   you know dad chandler is one of ross very best friends  06   ross sure is a great guy  06   i ve always felt that how a man turns out    06     is a reflection on his father  06   i always thought that too tell me what does your father do  07   he s a headliner of a    07     gay burlesque show  07   you re killing us will you serve the dessert already  07   there s drunken dancers awaiting  07   look at it isn t it beautiful  07   yeah what is it  07   it s a trifle it s got all these layers  07   first there s a layer of ladyfingers then jam    07     then custard which i made from scratch    07     then raspberries more ladyfingers    07     then beef saut ed with peas and onions    07     then a little bit more custard    07     then bananas and then i put whipped cream on top  07   what was the one right before bananas  07   the beef yeah that was weird to me too  07   but then i thought well there s minced meat pie  07   that s an english dessert  07   these people just put strange things in their food  07   can i borrow rum from your place  08   yeah sure  08   while i m gone don t you sneak a

12   hey rach can i talk to you outside for a sec  13   okay  13   what s up ross  13   so     13   thanksgiving  13   the holiday season is upon us  13   and    13     you look nice today  13   oh no

classes anymore  14   rachel there you are let s serve that dessert already  14   joey you have to stop rushing me you don t get any dessert  14   really  14   no just kidding i would never do that to you  14   okay everybody it s trifle time  14   so rach this is a traditional english trifle isn t it  14   it sure is wow  14   so did you make it with beef or eggplant  14   beef i can t have any i

  it s good  15   really how good  15   it s so good that i feel selfish    15     about being the only one who s eating it  15   i think we should have everyone taste how good it is  15   especially ross  15   this is so good that i m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony  15   so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert  16   i ve gotta call my friend    16     and tell her how good this is from monica s room  16   i ll help dial  16   i m gonna go into the bathroom    16     so i can look at it in the mirror as i eat it  16   what was that all about does it not taste good  16   let me try it no no  16   all gone  16   so good  16   maybe chandler has some left  16   it tastes like feet  16   i like it  16   are you kidding  16   what s not to like custard good  16   jam good meat good  16   so a bird just grabbed it    17     and then tried to fly away with it    17     and then just dropped it on the street  17   if it s any consolation before the bird dropped it    17     he seemed to enjoy it  17   rachel come here  17   i was taking my thanksgiving nap and i had another dream  17   do i want to hear this i don t know let s see  17   i dreamt we were getting married    17     and he left because he had to go fight a fire  17   so i went to a nightclub and i saw him making out with a girl  17   oh my god he dreamcheated on you  17   but then jacques cousteau came    17     and he kicked his ass for betraying me  17   so cool  17   then he took me diving and introduced me to his sea horse    17     who was coming on to me please that is not gonna happen  17   boy i m glad i wore the big belt today  18   five minutes ago a line like that would have floored me  18   but now nothing well not nothing i am still a woman  18   ross let s go  18   oh yeah about

the trifle  19   it did not taste good  20   phoebe i m sorry    20     but i think jacques cousteau is dead  20   monica why you felt you had to hide the fact    20     that you re in an important

 06   it s just     06   see i was a regular on a soap opera you know  06   and to go from that to this it s just     06   and plus i d have to wait on all my friends  06   okay but the money s good  06   plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want  06   what  06   flexible hours  06   maybe i could be a waiter  06   could i use the phone  06   she picked rachel  06   she tried to back out of it but it was obvious she picked rachel  06   he took my joke he just took it  06   this is wrong you know what else is wrong  06   phoebe picking rachel  06   know who else picked rachel ross  06   know what else ross did he stole my joke  07   i m gonna get a joke journal you know  07   and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes  07   good idea know what s a bad idea  07   picking rachel that s right  07   did you hear something  07   maybe it s the sound of ross climbing into my brain to steal my thoughts  07   it s coming from the living room  07   i finished my book  07   hey you guys hey  07   don t you guys look cute  07   you guys make a cute couple  07   what are you doing  07   just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place  07   remember when you picked rachel over me  07   that was funny  07   it was kind of funny it wasn t funny at all  08   why would you do that  08   why didn t you pick me  08   fine  08   the reason i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you    08     is just you know you re    08     high maintenance let s go to lunch  08   that is completely untrue  08   you think i m high maintenance prove it  08   you write out a list and we ll go through it point by point  08   no you re right you re easygoing  08   you re just not as easygoing as rachel she s just more    08     flexible and mellow that s all  08   well people are different  08   rachel will do whatever you want you can just walk all over her  08   what are you saying that i m a pushover i m not a pushover  08   oh okay you re not a pushover  08   you think i m a pushover well watch this  08   you re not invited to lunch  09   what do you think pretty strong i think  09   come on monica let s go to lunch  09   you start working

14   so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up  14   so ross selflessly offered to take me  14   what a nice story  14   so ross was in college  14   and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom  14   i definitely did not see that one backfiring  14   i m going to the bathroom take your time  14   i was a freshman and she was a senior so it wasn t as bad as  14   look i know i ve been giving you a lot of jabs  14   it s partly because i m very protective of lizzie  14   and partly because they just keep coming to me  15   i have to admit that after all the wonderful things lizzie has told me  15   and the many stories that rachel has told me  15   well  15   you re not  15   all bad  15   not all bad  15   i m sorry i was so harsh but you have to understand  15   i still look at lizzie like she s a 12yearold girl  15   i know what you mean i do that too  15   i beg your pardon i don t see her as a 12yearold girl  15   i mean i have a son who is six and i still think of him as a baby  15   you have a son  15   my exwife and i share custody of ben  15   just so you know carol and i are on excellent terms  15   as i m sure you are with your wife  15   i m sorry  15   it s unbelievable  15   don t worry i just didn t realize you were married  16   we were but that was just a  16   that was just a big drunken mistake  16   you re back  16   you two were married  16   i m sorry you were talking about emily  16   we said we would meet at the coffee house at 6     we said 7     we said 6     the only way that i said 6     would be if i said the sentence let s meet at 7 00 not at 6     if i had said 7 00 i would have said  16   my boyfriend is such a wiseass 7     hi oh my good god  16   i know what time you said what  16   well actually i know what time chester and marsha said  16   what time  16   what an interesting turn of events  16   suddenly it s my book to the rescue let s see  17   very interesting  17   well this certainly clears things

you re born with  19   you can teach it i can show you right now  19   well if you think about it  19   ross did learn something from each marriage  19   how to make the next one even shorter  19   wait a minute that s not fair  19   he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to emily  19   he just didn t tell me  19   maybe i have to pee again  19   well this is fun  19   so ross did you kill any of these wives  19   i have had enough of this i care a great deal about your daughter  19   and i have treated her with nothing but respect  19   so if you ve got a problem with me  19   are you yelling at me  19   god no  19   you know what daddy lf you don t like ross that s fine  19   it doesn t matter to me i m going to go out with him anyway  19   really  20   well if it doesn t matter to her  20   it doesn t matter to me still not yelling  20   what can i say  20   this doesn t make me like you more  20   that s okay i m not so crazy about myself right now either  20   then we agree i guess so  20   neither of us like ross i like ross  20   kids  20   wait i just thought of another story about how nice ross is  20   that s okay rach we re not liking ross right now

maybe she is too young for me  13   when i was over there i felt like i was a babysitter  13   i finally see what you were talking about i don t know what to do  13   just weigh the good stuff about

took out the trash  17   i have never had such a healthy breakup  18   she was such a grownup about it  18   she didn t seem too immature for me  18   did ljust make a huge mistake  18   ross wait  18   elizabeth thank god i was just thinking about  18   you suck  18   what  18   breakup s still on  18   here she comes  18   do i look like i don t want to get married  18   and also a little like a french guy  18   i never noticed that before  18   what are you up to  18   just hanging out talking about web sites  19   we saw this interesting web site about marriage  19   how unnecessary it is  19   how it s a way for governments to keep tabs on you  19   yeah big brother  19   that s a little crazy  19   although i am glad you re looking at other things on the lnternet  19   got me thinking why would anybody want to get married  19   to celebrate the relationship to solidify the commitment  19   to declare your love for one another to the world  19   well that s good to know  19   the mr bowmont s here  19   a customer wants to compliment you shall i let him in  19   sure i love this part  19   come on in hi  19   i m not here to compliment the chef  19   i hate when people come back to compliment the chef  20   like i ve nothing better to do  20   what s up  20   it was great seeing you the other night  20   good to see you too  20   came to tell me that  20   no came here to

 6x25 - The One With The Proposal (2).,what what did you what i still love you i know i shouldn t even be here telling you this you re with chandler who i really like you say he s straight i ll believe you after seeing you i knew if i didn t tell you i d always regret it letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did you re really not supposed to be back here i m sorry i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place    00     but i had to tell you 1i want to spend my life with you and marry you 1i want to have kids with you 1why don t they put chairs back here 1i know this is crazy but am i too late 1yes you re too late where was all this three years ago  00   i know i was an idiot  01   and i tried to forget you i really did  01   after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to forget  01   what were you doing in africa working with blind kids  01   what are you doing to me  01   look l     01   i m sorry but it s not gonna happen  01   that s fine i ll walk away and i ll never bother you again  01   only if you tell me chandler s willing to give you everything i am  01   well he is i mean    01     marriage is all he talks about  01   in fact i m the one making him wait  01   you are why  01   why  01   because of the government  01   the one with the proposal  part 2  01   english subtitles by gelula sdi  02   isn t it incredible  02   monica and chandler are getting married  02   i know they ll be so happy together  02   two best friends in love how often does that happen  02   not that often no  02   i m so happy for them  02   me too so happy for them  02   i m so happy and not at all jealous  02   oh no god definitely not jealous  02   i m probably 98 happy and maybe 2 jealous  02   what s 2 that s nothing  02   totally  03   i m like 901 0 yeah me too  03   have you guys seen chandler  03   no but you know who was looking for you  03   tenille  03   so that marriage stuff you were saying yesterday  03   you don t really believe that sure i do  03   in fact i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural  03   look at pigs let s take a second here and look at pigs  03   pigs don t mate for life  03   a pig can have 1 00 sexual partners in a lifetime  03   and that s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that s good at sports  03   wait a minute  03   are you telling me you may never want to get married  03   never say never but probably    03     yeah never  04   oh my god  04   then what are we even doing what is this  04   whoa whoa whoa what is all this pressure  04   is this some new strategy  04   why don t you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap  04   you know what i gotta go  04   it s okay i got a plan  04   we re gonna find love definitely  04   yeah i m pretty confident about that  04   that s what makes it so easy to be 80 happy for monica and chandler  04   would be nice to have a guarantee what do you mean  04   some people make deals with a friend  04   like if neither of them are married by 40 they marry each other  04   you mean a backup exactly  04   i ve got that  04   you do  04   who joey  04   joey are you serious  05   i locked him in years ago  05   wait so if neither of you are married by 40 you ll marry joey  05   yep we shook on it  05   but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal  05   seriously  05   i think his exact words were     05   charming  05   he s just a backup  05   hey monica  05   have you seen rachel or a mirror  05   it s for my boat cool huh  05   yeah it s great  05   what s the matter talk to the captain  05   just realizing i m in a deadend relationship  05   he s giving you a hard time  05   i don t want to get married tomorrow but i want to believe    05     we re going somewhere that i m not wasting my time  06   you know chandler no i don t know chandler  06   not anymore it s like something s changed  06   maybe you changed  06   i didn t change  06   maybe that s the problem  06   what chandler is a complex fellow  06   one who is unlikely to take a wife  06   does he think i ll just wait around for nothing  06   face it chandler is against marriage  06   and always will be  06   well there s some people who do want to marry me  06   there are yeah richard  06   richard said he wants to marry you  06   and chandler says he hates marriage that s right  06   chandler loves marriage  06   you just told me he hates marriage  06   that he s a complex fellow who s unlikely to take a wife  06   that he s against marriage and always will be  07   you got that from what i said  07   rach hey you  07   come on in thank you  07   i m so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth  07   thanks yeah i really thought we d be able to make it work  07   i guess it just wasn t meant to be  07   yeah love  07   it s a tricky business isn t it  07   i guess so  07   so what do you say we make a pact  07   if you and i are both single by 40 we get married  07   i mean we know each other we like each other    07     we ve already slept together so there ll be no surprises there  07   no like what s that  07   oh you want me to be your backup exactly  07   yeah i already have one  07   who phoebe  07   phoebe  08   but she just said joey is her backup  08   oh i don t think so  08   i just spoke with her she said that she and joey made a deal  08   that s impossible we have had a deal for years  08   we shook on it  08   although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that  08   where have you been  08   i was making a coconut phone with the professor  08   richard told monica he wants to marry her  08   what i ve been looking for you  08   stop messing with her  08   and i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn t keep flying off  08   oh my god i know they suck  08   he s not supposed to ask her to marry him i am  08   i know what  08   you know what i ll do i ll go over there and kick his ass  08   will you help me  08   look us getting our asses kicked is not a solution  09   look just go and find monica you re right  09   i m gonna get the ring    09     i ll go find her    09     and i ll propose  09   dude dude dude  09   that coconut phone might be good for the boat  09   hi  09   hi  09   i don t know why i m here  09   i didn t ask  09   you want to come in  09   i don t know  09   oh okay  09   i ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch  09   chandler is such an idiot  09   drink  10   scotch on the rocks with a twist  10   i remember  10   you still smoking cigars  10   no that s art  10   if it bothers you i can put my art out  10   no that s okay  10   so monica    10     iet me ask you a question  10   since we broke up do you ever    10     think about me  10   actually i thought about you a couple months ago  10   really yeah but it s because l    10     had an eye exam and i don t like my new eye doctor  10   who is it edward nevsky  10   yeah he s no good  10   do you ever think about me in    10     a noneyedoctor way  10   no  10   because getting over you was the hardest thing i ve ever had to do  11   i never let myself think about you  11   phoebe you picked joey and ross  11   you can t have two backups  11   of course i can  11   it s just good sense to back up your backup  11   look i ve already lost chandler what  11   hey phoebe  11   we re both backups  11   how could you do this to me  11   what are you complaining about you were both aware of the situation  11   i was not no we weren t  11   this kind of back talk isn t gonna fly when we re married  11   you can t have both pick one  11   pick me no pick me  11   i don t want to end up an old maid  11   well let s see  11   ross is a good father  11   but    11     joey has a boat this is hard  11   this is crazy i want to switch to rachel  11   i want to switch too  12   no wait  12   wait guys don t make any rash decisions  12   remember my promise  12   if we get married three times a week  12   oh my god phoebe     12   i m talking about massages  12   no i m not  12   i know how to settle this here s what we ll do  12   i ll write joey     12     on one napkin  12   and i m going to write ross on the other napkin    12     and we ll pick one  12   that person will be our backup here we go  12   that sounds fair all right  12   good switching them up  12   pick one left  12   thank you you re welcome  12   ross joey  12   we should just switch absolutely  12   i miss this apartment  13   now this is a grownup s apartment  13   i should be with a grownup you know  13   you re saying you need to be with someone more mature  13   maybe someone with    13     a license to practice medicine  13   or a mustache  13   let s face it i m not a kid anymore  13   i need to be with someone who wants the same things  13   coming to my work and telling me you love me i want that  13   talking about pig sex over lunch i don t want that  13   i think that s fair  13   fair please don t even talk to me about fair  13   fair would ve been you wanting to marry me then  13   or chandler wanting to marry me now  13   believe me nothing about this is fair nothing  13   nothing nothing it s okay  13   nothing  14   i don t know  14   i

story  08   it was going great i let him win we were bonding    08     he even said i could call him dad  08   and what did he ask you not to call him  08   daddy  08   look here s the story  08   we hadjust finished playing and we were gonna take a steam  08   i walk into the room  08   and it s really steamy  09   so i take off my glasses and that s when it happened  09   guys  09   over here have a seat son  09   hey  09   oh my god i can t believe it i know  09   you gave my father a lap dance  09   why do they put so much steam in there  09   because otherwise they d have to call it the room room  09   why why did that have to happen  09   come on it s not that big a deal  09   not that big a deal  09   there was touching of things  09   i know you wanted to bond with my dad    09     but did you have to bond to that part  10   i m sure dad doesn t care  10   he probably thought it was funny  10   he ll be telling this story for years  10   i don t want him to tell this story for years  10   oh but he will  10   he still tells the story about how monica tried to escape from fat camp  10   i wasn t escaping  10   then how d you get caught in the barbed wire  10   i was trying to help out a squirrel  10   you were trying to eat it  10   if that is your father calling to tell this story    10     then the marriage is off  10   come on hello  10   i m sorry you have the wrong number  10   i ll call you later dad i love you  10   i m off to see your dad  10   aren t you a little overdressed  10   you better make sure he tips you this time  11   i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore    11     and i figured the best way to do that was face to face  11   and by face i don t mean his lap  11   and by face i don t mean my ass  11   are you getting monica and chandler a present  11   i don t know you know they didn t get us anything  11   thank you  11   hey  11   well hello  11   so when are we getting back out on the water matey  11

y1 488 y2 524 you think i m hot  12   x1 218 x2 497 y1 488 y2 524 you own the room  12   x1 143 x2 571 y1 484 y2 524 we should probably get the   12   x1 127 x2 591 y1 484 y2 524 oh yeah yeah we

104 x2 613 y1 446 y2 524 i notice that is that because she s so passionate  13   x1 175 x2 542 y1 444 y2 524 no it s because that way the camera only sees her  13   x1 220 x2 496 y1 484 y2 524 you

right we said your parents decided to raise you as a girl but you still had a hint of a penis  oh my god  you started that  you heard that  everyone at our school heard it you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader oh no it makes sense this is why adam carter wouldn t go out with me why billy would just stay in this region billy s gay now so that one s not really our fault  why didn t you tell me  i

edge  what s that  oh it s parker  look the bunny hop  oh i love it  you do are you kidding people acting like animals to music come on okay it s time for the toast i know normally ross gives the toast but this year i ll do it no it s gonna be great really okay mom dad when i got married the thing that made me sure i could do it was the example you two set for that and other things i want to thank you i know i probably don t say it enough but i love you when i look around i m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here nana my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here but she can t because she s dead as is our dog chichi i mean look how cute she is was do me a favor pass this to my parents remember she s dead okay her and nana gone wow does anybody remember when debra winger had to say goodbye to her children in terms of endearment didn t see that no movie fans  you want to hear something sad i was watching a 60 minutes piece on orphans in romania who have been so neglected that they were incapable of love you people are made of stone here s to mom and dad whatever thank you monica that was interesting  wasn t it interesting jack  why don t i remember this dog ross why don t you give us your toast now oh no mom it s just monica this year you re not saying anything on our 35th wedding anniversary no of course everybody i just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride rachel and myself that if if in 35 years we re half as happy as you guys are we ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world oh ross i just wish nana were alive to hear ross toast my god what a fantastically welllit hallway can i get you something to drink like a water and valium i must say this apartment it s there are no words  thank god  it s a haven  a thirdfloor

something let s play a game  i love games  shocking let s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest or jenga let s play this one first and remember whoever talks first loses  i lose now jenga  oh my god  is something wrong  you know the word wrong everything isn t perfect or magical everything isn t aglow with the light of fairies  they were just brake lights parker  excuse me for seeing good in traffic you don t have to put a good spin on everything  i m sorry i m a positive person  no i m a positive person you are like santa claus on prozac at disneyland getting laid you want me to be negative you want me to be less happy much less happy fine well then to quote ross i better be going so long don t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out isn t this the most incredible fight you ve had in your life we could ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar it just isn t feasible but a dove placing the ring on your finger would ve been no problem  it was fun being married to you  yeah and it was an easy 400 bucks  okay ross can i ask you something  yeah  that proposal at the planetarium  i know i know it was stupid are you kidding with the lilies and the song and the stars it was really wonderful did you just make that up i thought of it when we were going out that s how i imagined i would ask you to marry me wow well that would ve been very hard to say no to it s a good thing i didn t do it it sounds like a very expensive wedding  okay good night  good night even if the sidecar had a windscreen to protect your hair  i will think about it  that s all i m asking okay that s it i give up at mom and dad s 40th anniversary you give the speech you know i don t understand why they didn t cry  come on  that stuff you said about true love you were right we did learn a lot from mom and dad that picture of chichi with her mischievous grin and what you said about nana yeah she really would ve wanted to be there and you know what i think she was oh good god ross how the hell do you do it english

fell out of ross jacket  and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing  ross had a ring and he was gonna propose   i guess  and you did it first  this is gonna kill him you know how much he loves to propose  i know i know it s awful  well what did she say  she said yes  does ross know  oh my god what the hell am i gonna tell him   maybe you don t have to tell him  i like that yeah  if you clear things up with rachel ross never needs to find out  but you have to do it before he hears about it and kicks your ass  all right let s not get carried away  i want a baby  honey we ve been over this i need to be facing the other way  if we have sex again it ll double our chances of getting pregnant   i think that closet s still available  i am so tired   yeah okay but no foreplay  deal  dad seriously  you know you really should see someone about that  noted  i wanna go talk to rachel for a minute are you gonna be okay alone for a bit  are you kidding me i could stay and look at her forever  actually   hey  hi  are you all right   i think i just got engaged  oh my god he did it  what did you know he was gonna ask me  are you kidding i m like the one who talked him into it  i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group   and you really think this is a good idea  i just talked him into it  don t tell me i have to do you too   the puppet master gets tired people  okay  i don t know it just doesn t feel right  why you two are so meant to be together everybody thinks so  really even ross  especially ross  hey pheebs you know what i ll come back later  wow kind of a full house here  i guess i ll just i ll come back there he goes your fiance i guess so although he does play with himself in his sleep i can t say i m surprised  dad what are you doing  there are people in there having sex it can t be me i m standing right here  wanna peek  no come on you know what i don t like you without mom come on we re not peeking well i m peeking oh my god hello sir you know monica  hey is it okay to come in  of course joey this ring l it s beautiful i love it yeah look rach there s something i gotta tell you  hey  hi  are you ready to try nursing again  yeah hi emma why do you think she won t take my breast it s all right it takes babies a while to get it  but don t worry it ll happen  okay okay sweetie you can do it just open up and put it in your mouth dear lord  i m sorry honey what were you saying  yeah look i think that because look she s pulling away again do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth she looks scared doesn t she look scared you know i don t really know her why don t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow  okay  are you kidding me this is so frustrating why doesn t she want my breast i don t know maybe she s crazy  hey wait up  hi congratulations i didn t want to say anything in front of joey i didn t know if he knew what that we had a baby now let s give him a little credit although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier no no that you and rachel are engaged  what  oh it s a secret goody yes we haven t done the secret thing in a long time phoebe there is no secret okay i didn t propose are you lying is this like that time you tried to convince us you were a doctor i am a doctor you know what i m just gonna go and talk to rachel myself all right well me too  well should we wake her up  no no come on let her sleep  she s so exhausted  and so engaged oh my god she thinks we re engaged why why why would she think we re engaged perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring you know ross doctors are supposed to be smart  i didn t give her that ring  you didn t  no  so whose ring is it it s mine  is it an engagement ring  yes  but you didn t give it to her  no  but you were going to propose  no i might be losing interest in this look look my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel but all i wanted to do was see if she maybe kind of wanted to start things up again what beautiful lukewarm sentiment i didn t want to rush into anything it seemed like she didn t want to either but i don t understand how any of this happened what did she find the ring in my jacket assume i was gonna propose throw it on and just start telling people no no she said you actually proposed to her well i didn t i didn t propose unless did i i haven t slept in 40 hours and it does sound like something i would do look we can t stay in here forever it s just i still can t believe that my dad saw us having sex he didn t make it to one of my piano recitals but this he sees this is okay we re all adults here there s nothing to be ashamed of now let s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door hi dad  i can still call you that right  of course i ll always be your dad i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there that wasn t for fun  it wasn t fun  why why why would you look i just don t want you to think that we re animals who do it whenever we want well i don t think that before today i never thought of you two having sex at all it was a simpler time the truth is dad we re trying  what  yeah we re trying to get pregnant oh my god this is so exciting well get back in there i ll guard the door that s okay dad we can wait until later whoa i don t think so aren t you ovulating daddy you gotta get at it princess when your mother and i were trying to conceive you whenever she was ovulating bam we did it that s how i got my bad hip that s funny this conversation s how i got the bullet hole in my head this one time i had my knee on the sink and your mother was daddy i don t think we need to hear the specific positions you and mom had you re right this is about your positions now what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child  although it might feel good  i don t feel good right now but pleasure is important and it helps if the woman has an orgasm you up to the task sailor seriously sir my brains all over the wall  hey  hey oh i need to tell you something well now s a good time i m on my way to have my ears cut off joey asked me to marry him  what  joey proposed to me  is he crazy you just had ross baby  well i said yes what are you crazy you just had ross baby it s so inappropriate no it is worse than that it is wrong it is bigger than mine i know days of our lives thank you very much  you can t marry him  why not come on i don t want to do this alone and he s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much well do you love him sure  sure  yeah i mean whatever honey

all right yeah everything s great i was just watching some regular television there what a pleasant surprise  i m gonna go freshen up okay  okay honey that was close  hello  hey rach it s me okay i just got to chandler s room and i caught him molesting himself that couldn t have been pretty but you know guys do that well the weird part is he was getting off to a sharkattack show  no  yes chandler watches shark porn  while watching sharks  yeah are you sure that s what he was doing you know how many times i ve seen him jump up like that believe me i know what he was doing man sharks i always knew there was something weird about that dude you promised to love him no matter what what means like if he gets a disease or kills someone not if he gets his jollies to jaws you know what honey guys are just different they like things that we can t understand i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend that he was an archeologist and i was this naughty cavewoman who he unfroze from a block of ice are you talking about my brother i didn t disguise that very well did i  hey  hi i went out with this girl last night halfway through our date i realized i already slept with her you ve slept with all the women in ny and now you re going around again that s not even the weird part  she didn t remember sleeping with me  you don t remember sleeping with her but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable  you guys know  how do we know  we ve never slept with you  and whose fault is that what s the big deal you forgot she forgot  maybe you were having an off night  hey i never have an off night okay although sometimes if i m a little bloated i don t feel that sexy but even then i m better than most honey why don t you just let it go and ask her out again you re both so slutty you don t remember who you slept with you re made for each other interesting well i ll go out with her again and i ll try to get past it no salt bloaty  joey  what you don t think sharks are sexy do you no wait a minute wait what was the little mermaid it s open  hey  mike called we re going out again quick thing i went to talk to mike what what did you what did you do ross oh boy you got mad at that part i went over there you know to tell him how how great you are but well you know me blahblahblah  and i ended up telling him that  what you had a sixyearlong relationship with a guy named vikram what why well he seemed to bum hard when i told him you d never been in a serious relationship if you hadn t just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now i think you ll feel differently when you know a little bit about vikram okay he s a he s a kite designer and he used to date oprah i m not going along with some lie you made up ross  i m just gonna be honest with him  good just be honest with him  i have nothing to be ashamed of  no so i haven t been in a relationship that lasted longer than a month okay i haven t had a real boyfriend if he can t handle it then he can leave which he will and you know that s okay so i ll just be alone forever you know all right it ll be fine it ll be fine i ll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians  i ll get it  okay i m trying to remember the last time i opened a door and you weren t there phoebe are you okay yeah there s just there s something you should know vikram just called so it was really a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents getting divorced i took it the hardest because i was the youngest  sure yeah how can you not remember me what how could you not remember that we slept together  what when  i don t know i really really think i would remember sleeping with you come on come on search your brain all right it was a certain amount of time ago i was here you were here we had sex here here here not there  anything  no it s not ringing any bells my god woman how many people have you been with not to remember this hey hayley we really gotta fix that doorknob joey i slept with you and you obviously remember me hey i still got it so we re good i ll let myself out and i said okay vikram you can t just call every time you get lonely you gave up that right when you slept with rachel rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross yeah well yeah but emma s birth certificate might say geller  but her eyes say mukherjee that is so wrong and on top of that he s a glue sniffer i know but he calls and my heart goes to him you know that bastard is one smoothtalking freelance kite designer i think there s somebody better out there for you i mean you know i m i m not saying me but maybe me and you don t have to worry about gluesniffing with me although i do smell the occasional magic marker yeah anyway i just i think i can make you happy  okay i can t do this  what s wrong well there is no vikram ross made him up because i i really never have been in a longterm relationship i ve never lived with a guy i ve never even celebrated an anniversary so if that s too weird for you and you want to leave i understand in fact i ll close my eyes to make it less awkward you kissed me  you don t think i m a total freak  no well look can i can i think you re a little weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also want to kiss you i guess so can i think it s cool that you kissed me and also want to kiss you again and be a little concerned about the magic markers definitely y i this is vikram hi honey i m home hi  how was your flight  it was great why don t you sit down get yourself comfortable because i have a little surprise for you well well well it must be 5 00 in tulsa because it s sex o clock in nyc okay this is how much i love you y i the great white honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around is this is this not the good part do you want me to fastforward to something toothier no i m just not sure that you got the right movie that s all this is the only one they had at our video store though they did have something called crocodile killers or does it always have to be sharks does what always have to be sharks look we can do something else do you want me to get into the tub and thrash  what s going on  it s okay it s okay i still love you  let me be a part of this  let me be a part of this i saw what you were doing in tulsa angry sharks turn you on no they don t then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat oh my god when you came in i switched the channel i was just watching regular porn really yes just some good oldfashioned american girlongirl action can i tell you how happy that makes me you are an amazing wife really you are amazing you were actually gonna do this for me where do you find the strength and the understanding for that i m very very drunk right now ordinarily i would talk to her but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her did i not sleep with her maybe this is a wakeup call you know about your whole dating attitude you re in your 30s and you have never been in a longterm relationship here you go from woman to woman meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn t turn into something more serious you re right i love my life i actually did sleep with her english

 9x06 - The One With The Male Nanny.,hello  hello  i love my new job   honey you re screaming  you bet your ass i am  i just had the best first day ever  the kitchen twice as big as allessandro s  oh that s great  and clean not just health departmentclean monicaclean  awesome  oh and the people are so nice  there s this one guy jeffrey he s the maitre d   chandler you will love him  he is without a doubt the funniest guy i have ever met  the one with the male nanny  ripped by mrnch dhnetmk  subtitles processed by subtitle editor c digital higherground  igor janevski  2495  this is nice  i know   you need both hands for that  yeah i kind of do  well how s this  look at you two holding hands  is this getting serious  have you not talked about it yet  am i making you uncomfortable  if you were bigger you d hit me  i m sorry  it s obviously way too early for us to be having that conversation   is it  maybe not is it  when i got divorced  i didn t think i d feel this way about someone for a really long time  then again i didn t think i d meet someone like you and  this may be crazysoon but i want you to have this  no not that s gum  oh five bucks i love it when that happens you know   you don t know it s there  i know keep digging  sorry  it s a key  to be honest i think i d prefer the five dollars   it s to my apartment  wow  big step for phoebe and mike  i don t want you to feel like you have to give me your key   no i want to  thank god  wow i was starting to think i d never meet someone that  i wanted to do this with  here you go   this is cool  it really is  i know it it is amazing these little things open doors  so i don t go back to work for another four weeks  but we would like our nanny to start right away  so that emma could get a chance to know her  i think that s really smart  the easier we can make the transition for her the better  that s great great   so do you have any questions for us  not really  all right well thank you so much for coming   thank you  it was really nice to meet you   we will call you  oh you know wait  i do have one question  do you guys do random drug testing  boy we hadn t really thought of that  that s cool but if you do i m gonna need three days notice  okeydokey  we re never gonna find a nanny  come on rach we will i promise we have more interviews  worse comes to worst we can always reconsider the first one we met with   what the blond with no bra  she was blond  just a sec  okay this one s name is sandy  she s got a degree in early childhood education  she worked for her last family for three years  hi i m sandy  and she s a little mannish  oh my god david   is this a bad time  no it s a great time come in  wow hi  oh my gosh what are you doing here are you back from minsk  just for a couple of days  i m here to explain to the people who gave us our grant  why it s a positive thing that we ve spent all their money  and accomplished nothing  who cares it got you here  it got me to new york then i got in a cab at the airport  and the guy said where to  i just gave him your address i didn t even think about it  where s your luggage  damn it  all right i ll call the cab company  we can call them later can you just stand there for a moment  boy  there s an old russian expression that goes  roughly translated that means  this thing that i m looking at wow  thank you  you should see me when actually no i look pretty good  are you kidding  you know when you don t see someone for a long time  you build them up in your head you start thinking  come on don t be crazy nobody s that beautiful  but well you are  well so are you seeing anyone  no i m just the worst person ever how can i not tell david that i m seeing mike maybe he didn t give you a chance he said are you seeing someone and i said no well that would ve been your window i mean i don t know i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking oh my god it s david david s here he s so irresistible  really the scientist guy  really chandler continue then it gets worse because i told him i would see him tomorrow night  phoebe  i know evil i like mike so much you know it s just going really well oh my god isn t it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys yeah you know and given my lifelong search for irony you can imagine how happy i am  what are you gonna do  i mean i guess i just have to tell david that nothing can happen between us unless i don t you know complicated moral situation  no right no wrong  you have to tell david i knew i should ve had this conversation with joey funniest guy she s ever met i m funny right what do you know you re a door you just like knockknock jokes save it for inside so oklahoma s a crazy place you know they call it the sooner state frankly i d sooner be in any other state and what s with oklahoma having a panhandle can all states have stuff like that hey yeah i m from the waistband of wyoming but when i was 7 we headed over to the crotch was your cabin pressurized and don t get me started on the way the people from tulsa talk okay what s with the word y all you know just two words just pushed together are we all allowed to do that because if so i say why stop there you know your new poodle could be your noodle and fried chicken could be fricken waiter waiter excuse me i ll have the fricken see that s funny with the fricken right no it just reminds me of something this guy did today at work i told you about that funny guy jeffrey right yeah he came up well he did this bit you probably had to be there but it was liza minnelli locked in our freezer eating a raw chicken  were you there  no but it sounds fricken funny i really understand how hard it s gotta be to leave your child with another person i mean it s like leaving behind a piece of your heart sandy that s exactly what it is are you gay it s okay i get that a lot doing what i do but i am straight i m engaged actually  her name s delia  that s pretty so you re just like a guy who s a nanny i realize how it s a bit unorthodox for some people but i really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life is take care of a child okay like at my last job i met daniel when he was 3 weeks old and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person when i left i said i ll see you soon and he said to me skadandy that was his name for me i ll see you every day right in  it s okay  yeah kids say all kinds of crap oh god she must need her diaper changed  i can take care of that if you want  that would be great i love him i love him i love him come on rach he s a guy so what he s smart he s qualified give me one good reason we shouldn t try him out because it s weird why what kind of a job is that for a man a nanny i mean it s like if a woman wanted to be yes king i hope you don t mind i used some of my homemade lotion on emma it s a mixture of calendula and honey cream it ll dry that rash right up plus it keeps the hands young yes sandy you re hired that s great i m sorry it s just such an emotional thing when you re welcomed into a new family oh god come here you gotta be at least bi i need you to set me up for a joke when monica s around ask me about fire trucks i don t know chandler i m not so good with remembering lines thank god your livelihood doesn t depend on it i know right why are we doing this monica says that her maitre d is the funniest guy she s ever met  seriously she actually said that  yes am i crazy to be this upset  no being funny s your thing  yeah without that you just got lame with women  hi there you are fire trucks wow you look even more beautiful than you did yesterday in fact i m going to kiss you now  wait wait  i can t get away with stuff like that it sounded sexy in my head so i no no it s not that remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no well i am his name s mike  i should ve told you  no well yeah  i m sorry i m sorry  well it s okay i understand well are you happy with this guy  i am happy  damn it i m sorry i don t mean that i want you to be happy but only with me no that s not fair who cares leave him i don t mean that yes i do i m sorry i think i should probably go but david i just want you to know that you know telling you this is one of the hardest things i ve ever had to do well just so you know hearing it wasn t exactly a vladnik carnival either  can we at least hug goodbye  of course yeah you know and a kiss on the cheek wouldn t be totally inappropriate  no no  i mean  in minsk  yeah it s two on each cheek and one on the lips  well if that s what they do in minsk in new york it s oh boy is everything all right oh yeah no it s fine it s fine sandy was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancee and it was so beautiful her favorite flower is the camellia from the poem i can t hear it again you know i can t tell it again and i m fine never having heard it  rach can i see you for a sec  yeah excuse me do you realize that man has cried in our apartment three times i haven t cried that many times since i moved in look ross sandy s just sensitive that s all okay okay see that is the problem he is too sensitive too sensitive to take care of our baby no i mean that guy these are amazing sandy made madeleines this is exactly what i m talking about what kind of a guy makes delicate french cookies they re not even butch manly cookies with you know with chunks well you know i don t know what to say i mean i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men i gotta tell you ross it s not like you just came in from branding cattle hey there s sensitive and there s too sensitive okay what is too sensitive no i can t i can t do this it s bad but it s nice and nice is good and good is not bad ergo we should keep kissing  no no no  but ergo look david if you had never left then yeah we d probably still be together right now but you did leave and i m with mike and i really care about him goodbye the key works and you thanks for the face massage thank you did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny i think that s great did she tell you he plays the recorder recites poetry and bakes madeleines  how are they  lighter than air but that s not the point rachel and i hired a male nanny really guys do that  that s weird  thank you  that s like a woman wanting to be  what  what s the end of that sentence  yes what is the end of that sentence a penis model anyway did you tell chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you ever met  yeah so  wow really do you not know chandler is that why he s acting so weird he s jealous oh my god that is crazy  it s not like i m attracted to jeffrey  so what being funny is chandler s thing like ross thing is science academia being a good father  i can t believe he s that upset  you have to do some damage control because he s feeling like what are you guys talking about rachel and i hired a male nanny you got a man who s a nanny you got a manny you know i don t mind a male nanny but i do draw the line at male wet nurse you are on a roll mister if i d known you guys were coming over i would ve brought more pizza okay okay stop it you you stop it what is so funny about that i don t know it s just the way you say it i mean you re funny you have that funny thing you re a funny guy did you tell her what we talked about so those were pity laughs pity laughs  honey listen you have nothing to worry about with jeffrey oh yeah is he funnier than me well you re different funny i mean you re more sarcastic well he does bits and impressions and

on leave that s my boy awesome i m not gonna watch it i don t need to watch it i mean what good could possibly come from watching it well we know i m gonna watch it  hey dude what s up  don t judge me i m only human did you take that tape i had to lmagine you were married and you found a tape of your wife in another guy s apartment wouldn t you need to know what was on it i don t know who am i married to some girl she hot how did she get me to settle down all right i m gonna watch it i mean it s probably not even what i think it is even if it is it can t possibly be as bad as what i m picturing in my head can it see in my experience if a girl says yes to being taped she doesn t say no to much else i ll tell you  then you have to watch it for me  what just for a few seconds so i can know what it is please all right fine but if i enjoy this you have only yourself to blame  why am i hearing cheering  it s okay it s just a football game  it s just football  you were all worried for nothing it s football it s just football this is great this is the first time i ve ever enjoyed football i think it may be customary to get a beer what the  what are you doing  you don t wanna see what i just saw what are you guys doing oh my god is that richard okay please laugh for mommy please please laugh for mommy not funny huh well so is it only offensive novelty rap or maybe just you

do like big butts don t you you beautiful little weirdo you missed it she was laughing it was amazing it was amazing it was the most beautiful beautiful sound i know isn t it what d you do to get her to laugh you know i just a couple of things i tried different just sang a little the ltsybitsy spider you sang baby got back didn t you nothing else worked that girl is all about the ass and then it goes back to the chorus resolve and that s the end of the song i realize you hadn t asked to hear it but no one had spoken in 17 minutes phoebe writes lots of songs what was that one you sang the other night pervert parade  ode to a pubic hair  stop oh god is that veal mom i thought i told you phoebe s a vegetarian no that s okay that s okay i mean i am a vegetarian except for veal yeah no veal i love  phoebe you don t have to eat that  any baby animals kittens fish babies but you know especially veal you know and this nice vein of fat running through it yummy so what do you think so you stole that tape from richard s apartment listen to the judgment from the porn star that tape was never meant to be seen by joey i would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private monica look i don t think you and i have any secrets anymore not ready to joke about it yet see you later why in the world would you take this tape and why would you watch it because that s who i am okay i m sure a man like richard could see a tape like that and not be bothered it d just be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men s club over brandy and mustaches is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache this is about you and richard he s clearly not over you he keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants isn t that sad can t you see how pathetic that is don t be jealous you should feel bad for him yeah well poor richard he i can grow a mustache this is not our problem we have each other that s all that matters but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air cowboy boots i ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life good good play more because i wanna see how it ends  that s not me  what that s not you life is good again ride em cowgirl that bastard taped over me is that a problem it s just so insulting spring for a new blank tape doctor i can t imagine what he sees in her she actually makes me miss that pillpopping exwife of his hello dear  what s going on  we were just chitchatting  how s your friend  a little better do you know who s moving back into town tom and sue s daughter jen you remember her michael she s lovely wellbehaved and single  i m not interested  please darling let s be honest you can have all the sailor fun you want with that one  but let s be real  all right stop all phoebe has done is try and get you to like her maybe it s not clear but she did her best  she s a little different than you are  michael a pimp spit in her mouth so what if i can get past that it shouldn t bother you you don t have to like her just accept the fact that i do if you can t even be civil to the woman i love  the woman you what  yeah the woman you what the woman i love i love you something i shouldn t say for the first time in front of my parents and tom and sue who are by the way the most sinfully boring people i ve ever met in my life  i love you too  you do how great is

nose  amy  yes i do i really do  hello  yeah hang on one sec can i take this upstairs  sure we don t live there but  seriously it s just these rooms   i thought you were a doctor  yeah no ross has a phd  god she is unbelievable  i know i mean a phd is just as good as an md  sure ross yeah 9969 if i have a heart attack at a restaurant i want you there with your fossil brush  stupid thanksgiving  what  what what happened  my boyfriend canceled on me i mean i finally find a real relationship someone that i can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town i swear it s almost not even worth dating married guys don t say that god i was so looking forward to this it was gonna be such a beautiful thanksgiving we were gonna have sushi amy don t cry  ross can i talk to you in private  sure you wanna go upstairs or look i was thinking if it s okay with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving i think that s a great idea it ll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis look i know she s a little tough to take but she has nowhere else to go and she s my sister she s emma s aunt  and i would like them to bond  i don t want them bonding too much i don t want her telling emma she needs a nose job ross she may need one we re just gonna have to make our peace with that  hi  hey hey you guys this is my sister amy this is chandler joey phoebe and you know mon oh my god you re on days of our lives  yeah wow they must put a lot of makeup on you happy thanksgiving  hey  hi so welcome is this the first time you re seeing emma yeah i think so it s nice to meet you emma  phoebe  that s a funny noise  pheebs i still need some help here  right okay so it s not just the lie you tell but it s the way you tell it for example if you look at the ground when you talk people know you re lying i don t know why this is so hard for me lying is basically just acting and i am a terrific actor  you are a terrific actor  hey where s the baby  we just put her down for a nap listen i was just thinking you know what would be incredible if you guys died thank you amy no no then i would get the baby it would be just like a movie at first i wouldn t know what to do with her and then i would rise to the occasion then i d get a makeover and get married that s a great movie yeah listen not that you guys could stop me or anything because you know you d be dead but i was thinking about changing her name i m just not really a big fan of emily emma emma ross wants you phoebe why does she keep making that noise honey i don t know how to tell you this but if something were to happen to ross or myself you wouldn t get the baby  well who would well we haven t officially asked them yet but we would want monica and chandler i can t believe you d want us to raise emma oh my god i m so moved i don t believe this hold on a second you guys die and i don t get your baby amy see we re a lot closer to monica and chandler we see them every day and truthfully you don t seem connected to the baby connected to what she s a lump you know guys i ve gotta say this means so much to me i mean that you would trust me with your child i mean we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own you know i ve had my doubts about my skills as a father but that you two  that you two  this guy seriously okay it s time for dinner everyone we re using our fancy china and it s very expensive so please be careful okay just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be wellreceived hey how come my plate s less fancy than everyone else s do you not trust me with a fancy plate no honey that s a special plate see it s a game whoever gets that plate wins i can t believe i won you know this is such a slap in the face i mean i m your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me monica is ross sister no ross sister was really fat that was me no she was this dorky girl in school who followed rachel around like a puppy amy you ve got to stop doing that okay listen i know you re having a bit of a family crisis but you don t have to take it out on the plates i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this now see this way you protect the plates and let s face it you have fun okay how about this if you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do i get the baby  no if crazy plate lady if monica dies then i would get emma right  well actually  actually what it s just it s just that in that case then emma would go to my parents  what  hurts doesn t it who has to die for me to get her so if monica s not around i m not good enough to raise emma no that is not what we re saying yeah he s lying he looked down well what s wrong with me am i incompetent because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you you re taking this the wrong way we think you ll be a wonderful parent it s just you re more the you know fun parent yeah and we wanna make sure emma also has someone like monica who s more of a disciplinarian someone who can be firm and strict that s not how you see me is it no you re all about the fun i may not know a lot about babies but do you really think i m not capable no you both are equally capable it s just you re strongest when you re together okay so if we both had emma and i died she d have to give her up sure monica would have to give her up i lie better than that right let me just get this straight so my two friends die i get emma then my wife dies then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me  there s your movie hey there you are  you disappeared after dinner  did somebody miss me was there a child to raise poorly ross and rachel don t know what they re saying it s not like they re so responsible emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a fiveyearold condom no but they re right i m not a strong father figure and i never will be no you learn these things you grow into it yeah but it s not who i am everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid and it s true  and look everybody knows it  i don t know it i wanna have a kid with you because i think you ll be an amazing dad at the fun parts and at the hard parts well can you picture me saying go to your room you re grounded can you hear me say you re grounded you said that to me last week how hard is it no shoes on the furniture the producer from days left a message asking why i wasn t at the parade they said everybody s really pissed off at me and they all got to meet santa it s okay i thought of the perfect lie for you it s easy to remember and it doesn t invite a lot of questions you weren t at the parade because you had a family emergency i like that yeah i wasn t at the parade because i had a family emergency what happened  my sister s raccoon came  no nothing with a raccoon  wait what are you doing  setting the table we thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too how nice maybe later we can all blow our noses on my wedding dress hey dude you okay sorry about before that s okay you re totally right i don t know anything about disciplining a child but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that if i die you don t get joey in case you hadn t noticed i m not talking to you you know this is just this is classic rachel right remember in high school when i died and didn t give you my baby this might be my one chance to have a child rachel i mean you know that i have been so busy focusing on my career  what career  i m a decorator you decorate dad s office and now you re a decorator okay i went to the zoo yesterday now i m a koala bear  why can t you ever be supportive  you want to talk supportive you didn t come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby you didn t come see me in the hospital when i was getting my lips done i did the first time you know what you want to know why i am not giving emily to you  emma  whose side are you on  i m not giving you emma because you can t handle the responsibility of a child well how hard could it be you do it you wanna know why you don t want me to have the baby because you don t want me to be happy  you have always been jealous of me  jealous of what of your lack of responsibility your immaturity your total disregard for other people s feelings to name a few you ve always been like this you had to have everything and i couldn t have anything like in junior high when you stole timmy from me i mean do you even realize how much that hurt me timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him come on that was 20 years ago get over it i cannot believe that i invited you here today yeah well you know what i cannot believe that my socalled sister gets a 30 discount from

sense  sorry you had to waste all this time  you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time  now i ll get to use my shredder  i mean i could write slogans how hard could it be right  cheese it s milk that you chew  crackers because your cheese needs a buddy  a grape because who can get a watermelon in your mouth  i got one  socks because your family s feet deserve the best  honey

too look i ll just get my old job back no i want you to have a job that you love not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration i quit and you learn what i do i think there s never gonna be a right time to have a baby now you re unemployed and in a little while you ll find a new job that ll keep you really busy there s always gonna be a reason not to do this but i think once the baby comes we ll forget about all those reasons i guess i mean it s always gonna be scary when we have a baby it s gonna be really scary i mean god when we have a baby there s gonna be so much that we re not able to control i mean the apartment s gonna be a mess i won t have time to clean it what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer and messes up all the ribbons what if there s no room for a ribbon drawer because the baby s stuff takes up all the space where will all the ribbons go should we go make a baby before you change your mind  yes please  okay and i promise i will not fake it this time well i wish i could say the same i m a little shook up i know you botched that operation on purpose i can t prove it yet but when i do you ll be going to jail for murder i don t care if you are my brother i

out on your balcony  our balcony seriously  that s so funny i told monica we should put lights on our balcony  and she said no no it s too cold nobody will go out there and i said  maybe if we put some lights out there they will  right that s what i came over to talk about i saw rachel kissing some guy  on your balcony even though there were no lights  so are you gonna talk to her  why why should i i mean if she wants to move on that s fine  you know when that s fine sounds true when someone yells it and spits  no i m serious i mean if she wants to date people fine i don t care  but at least she could have told me  you know i ve been putting my life on hold and concentrating on emma  but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows then so will i  very funny ross is gay  no no good so you re moving on  do you have any idea where you re moving on to  i ve got plenty of opportunities  just now there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me  and then the other day on the subway a woman accidentally sat on my hand  dude don t rub my face in your crazy single life  and there s an anthropologist at school  who totally came on to me during the interdepartmental potluck dinner  why did i get married  the one where monica sings  ripped by mrnch dhnetmk  subtitles processed by subtitle editor c digital higherground  igor janevski  4118 hey let me ask you guys something  i m having new headshots taken tomorrow  the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed  is that weird for a guy   well it depends  on  on how far along he is in the

night   my god  you kissed him  yeah it was after the party we were on the balcony  wait wait wait i was at home the whole time how did i miss that  well it was the end of the party you were probably ironing wrapping paper  oh yeah  so how did you end up kissing  we were all alone and he was being really nice  and he gave me this scarf  i thought you hated him  well there is a thin line between love and hate  and it turns out that line is a scarf  are you thinking of starting something up with this guy  i don t know it s so complicated i work with this guy  i have the baby and i have ross i don t know what to do  and i have to be at the office and see gavin in 10 minutes  sounds like you need to think about what you want and talk to gavin   and you definitely should talk to ross  or  i

know that s funny yeah so do you think you ll ever work again what are you doing you know i can only dish it out i can t believe rachel just moved on and didn t say anything to me maybe she didn t

highroad all right you know what enough enough talking i have to get moving hey check out those two blonds over there hey come with me are you trying to get everybody divorced you don t have to do

back to the apartment now i don t know are we just kissing guys on balconies  how do you know about that  through the magic of sight  i was here putting our child to sleep  emma when i looked through the window and saw you kissing a guy you ve known for what a week god is that what this is all about you bring her up here to get back at me no actually see i had to pee because i can t use public bathrooms because of the doody parasites  okay michelle it s time to go  well call me  okay wait you don t have my phone number you know what if it s meant to be i ll guess it byebye score did you not like her because i was hoping we could come to your kissing parties on the balcony i can t believe you are making a big deal about this it was one kiss  one guy one time  oh really  yeah  oh really oh yeah  what about the guy from the bar  who the guy you gave your number to  how do you know about that  because he called here looking for you so don t tell me kissing this guy from work is a onetime thing because you ve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now and you don t even have the courtesy to tell me  why didn t i get that message  what from the guy in the bar why didn t i get that message because i folded it up and put it in my pants pocket do you not look there ross i never gave it to you why  i don t know  oh god you know what i don t who do you think you are who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get  who am i i m the guy who s taking care of our baby while you re at bars meeting guys  i cannot believe you i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation about us but i can t do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment hey none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me that s not the point okay the point is you are the one who moved on and didn t tell anyone oh god ross this is just so messed up what is wrong with us when people hear about our situation they ask you live together but you re not a couple yet you have a baby isn t that weird and i say no it s not because it works for us but you know what this doesn t work  in fact this is the opposite of working  clearly and you know we said that we would live together as long as this makes sense and maybe this just doesn t make sense anymore yeah maybe not so what do you wanna do hi can emma and i live here for a while god  of course  thank you your eyebrows look weird so you ll just touch yourself for anything then english

name one of their kids joey  i may not have kids someone s got to carry on the family name  you know what maybe once they start dating and see what s out there  they ll realize how good they are for each other  yeah because it is slim pickings  i had this date last night yuck  but we should probably keep it down she s still in the bedroom  so what are we gonna do are we just gonna set them up with people  i know that just pushes them further and further apart  i know what we can do we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates  so they ll realize how good they are together   that s a great plan  yeah  you know what the best part of it is i get to do my plan laugh  okay shh not so loud we don t want to wake up  hi you guys aren t doing anything tonight are you  see now why would

i got for ross  oh yeah  okay she s this really boring woman she s a teacher   a teacher  she s into history and foreign movies  and she loves puzzles  come on who loves puzzles  well ross does  you re ruining the plan  joey you fixed him up with his perfect woman   oh my god you re right  yeah  she even reads for pleasure   how do you know a woman like that  i m not allowed to know smart women   joey  we met at the library i went in to pee   so now what do we do  well okay  i ll call her and tell her the date s canceled and find him somebody else 9993 what if we don t find him somebody else we ll just tell her the date s off but we don t tell ross he ll go to the restaurant and get stood up i hear that s bad so this is great rachel s gonna have a terrible date ross gets stood up and then

well i can t say hump or screw in front of the baby i don t know i guess having sex in front of a baby isn t so  horrifying scarring something people go to jail for  i guess you re right  you guess at that bedandbreakfast we didn t have sex because you thought a deer was staring through the window well what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer wow everything looks so good i think i m gonna have the chicken i just have to say this  you re really beautiful  wow that s very sweet thank you i m kind of funnylooking  what  look i mean come on you re way out of my league everybody in here knows it i bet that guy over there is probably saying why s she out with him he must be rich well i m not what do you think you want to order i m real excited about that chicken i m not funny either so if you were thinking well he s not that goodlooking but maybe we ll have some laughs that ain t gonna happen well come on steve let s not rule out nervous laughter hey now wait a

the other person doesn t show up oh no do you think she walked in saw you and left why does everyone keep saying that if it makes you feel any better i wish my date hadn t shown up  that bad  well he makes tshirts for a living and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this female body inspector what size is that now wait a minute so they re gonna name their first child joey how do i get them to name the next one after me it s easy you just walk in on them having sex oh so they owe me like three phoebes oh my god look it s ross and rachel the plan is working don t do the plan laugh

even show wait a minute you don t think it was intentional i mean that s just stupid we re geniuses  look at them they re really bonding  they re falling in love all over again oh they see us oh they look mad they figured it out they re coming run  where  mexico can you believe they re still not here i know a double blind date and we both get stood up what are the chances i know i m so bummed

was horizontal and i should be more vertical  he said that i should think less  well so far so good honey i m old what s wrong i am so much older than these other interns i can t compete with them so you re a little older look at the positive you have all this life experience yes but i don t think life experience is gonna help me with these wow it s like they re on fire  what are they  prototype sneakers i need ideas on how to sell them which i can t do because no selfrespecting adult would ever wear these i ll give you 500 for them  what am i supposed to do  come on sneakers are easy  you wear them all the time  they re not called sneakers anymore they re called kicks or skids i think i heard somebody say slorps they ve got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because apparently walking is too much exercise kids kids roll your way to childhood obesity would you help me try to sell these okay have you considered using a girl with huge knockers that s not what they re looking for hey that would work on me why do you think i buy mrs butterworth s you ll never guess what just happened  phoebe and i got mugged  are you okay yeah phoebe knew the mugger how do you know a mugger i m sorry i have friends outside the six of us know how she knew him because phoebe used to mug people seriously well i m not proud of it but you know when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff  that is awful  i wasn t rich like you guys okay i didn t eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life my mother was killed by a drug dealer  your mother killed herself  she was a drug dealer it was a good thing she knew him i was about to do some serious damage okay this must have brought back some bad memories for you ross  why  ross was mugged as a kid  you were  yeah and it was pretty traumatic it was outside st mark s comics i was minding my business seeing what kind of trouble spiderman was into wonder woman anyway i was heading towards this bakery to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone when out of nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says  give me your money punk  oh my god i know and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i did for my own comic book science boy  oh yeah what was his super power again a superhuman thirst for knowledge i better get to class are there any more of your friends i should look out for no actually you might want to stay away from jane street that s where stabby joe works  i think we have a problem here  what back in my mugging days i worked st mark s comics  yeah  a pipe was my weapon of choice and preteen comicbook nerds were my meat so there was one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said  geology rocks  geology rocks  oh my god  i know i mugged ross  you re late  i know i m sorry but can i just run to the bathroom  no leonard doesn t wait  but i am bursting with yoohoo joey here we go let s go very quickly  i really need  we must go now quickly  yeah yes sir  ready  what the hell are you still doing here  i think you know  oh you sick bastard  i am what you made me know what  what  i could go right now  then go go  oh i can t i want to but i can t cut that was good  very good you did everything i asked  i did yes plus which you ve got this i don t know this squirmy quality you bring to the character i couldn t have imagined here s what we re gonna do come back tomorrow for the final callbacks do all of this what you got going now but you know what more more can you do that sure i don t have time to say thank you because i really gotta go look at that still in character i like him i plant seeds i can t explain it i don t know  hey what are you doing  putting on the sneakers to get in the young mindset see if it sparks anything  oh anything yet  yes how s this they re so uncomfortable it s like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet you re probably wondering what i m doing no that seems about right yesterday at my audition i had to pee apparently that makes me a good actor i got a callback so i m drinking everything oh by the way that eggnog in our fridge was great  joey that was formula  we gotta get more of that these aren t half bad you should suggest these to ralph lauren okay first of all that s stupid second i m not allowed to talk to ralph all right i feel younger already yeah i think i broke my hip  hey you  hey hey how was class no one asks me that what s wrong  nothing i really want to know  oh well there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene all right nothing is worth this i have a confession to make okay you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid what are you talking about it wasn t a girl it was this huge dude you don t have to lie anymore i know that it was a 14yearold girl  no it wasn t  yes it was you don t think i would have defended myself against a 14yearold  give me your money punk  oh my god it was you i can t believe it you mugged me yeah and i m so so sorry ross i m sorry but you know if you think about it it s kind of neat i mean well it s just that i ve always felt kind of like an outsider you know the rest of you have connections that go way back and you know now you and i have a great one it s not the best i know please forgive me i don t know what to say there s nothing you can say that was the most humiliating thing ever  even more humiliating than  let s not do this and then at the end of the commercial the girls get out of the hot tub and start making out with each other that s interesting just one thought you didn t mention the shoes who s next chandler you start with a guy putting on the shoes  he s about my age  your age he s rolling down the street and he starts to lose control maybe he falls maybe he hurts himself just then a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes he jumps over the old guy and laughs and the line reads not suitable for adults  well chandler that s great  thank you sir or man who s two years younger than me you see that has a clear selling point it appeals to our key demographic  how did you come up with that  i don t know i don t know i was just trying to get into a young mindset and stuff started to flow  that is great good work  thank you we ll see all of you tomorrow the cold weather hurts my hip hey ross i know you re still mad at me but can i just talk to you for a sec sure go ahead oh sorry sure go ahead i just really wanted to apologize again and also show you something i think you ll find very exciting oh my god crap from the street look ross in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke anyway i was looking through it and i found  science boy oh my god i never thought i d see this again it s all here what made you save it all these years i guess i just thought it was really good and maybe it would be worth something one day you really thought science boy was worth saving yeah but you should know i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here still this is amazing oh my god thank you phoebe you re welcome thank you for science boy i learned a lot from him you re welcome  i need an answer  i can t tell you something i don t know  you know  i don t know  i need an answer now  you want an answer the answer is she never loved me she only loved you you knew

patterns this is easy can t do this wow seriously can t do this  hey joe  hey listen i need to ask you a favor and we can t tell monica anything about it  i thought you guys didn t have secrets  that will remain the official party line look monica and i are having a little financial trouble  yeah i know  what what do you mean you know i just figured it out you know i mean you re not working and the economy is bad oh right that is the fastest i have ever thought anyway i need to borrow some money oh sure yeah how much two thousand dollars yes 2000 exactly how did you know that i know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is oh okay i am on fire listen this is really nice did you write a check to monica for 2000 did monica borrow money from you  kind of  i can t believe her did she tell you we were having money problems no no no it wasn t because of your money problems it was for something for her what something personal what would she get for 2000 that she wouldn t tell me about excuse me boob job i don t want her to get a boob job that s crazy well it s not that crazy okay making them smaller that would be crazy oh hey i wanted to ask you about monica s little groomie joke well i think the reason people laughed is that it s a play on the word roomie i get the joke sophisticated as it was no the thing i want to say is maybe we should ve talked about this before us living together you re not expecting a proposal right  oh no no not at all  okay we re just moving in right now we ll see where it goes yeah well that s the thing for me it s as far as it can ever go  what do you mean  look phoebe i i love you very much but i never want to get married again  wow  it s just my first marriage was you know such a disaster that i kind of lost faith in the whole idea  was it that bad  at one point near the end she deliberately defecated on my  okay well that s bad yeah but don t you think it might be different with someone else perhaps a blond who always uses the toilet except for once in the ocean look it s not about who i would marry i was certain the first time i got married it d last forever i was wrong  but it just  look phoebe it s not about you i just never want to get married again i m sorry are you okay with that if not maybe us moving in together isn t the best idea no oh i definitely don t want to get married i just wanted to make sure you didn t want to too because if we move in and you start changing your mind there is gonna be hell to pay mister  trust me i will never  yeah i get that yeah hi so you gave in and decided to call someone yeah i don t know who i was kidding i can barely use chopsticks  you re all set  oh thank you so much wait you forgot your game thank you hey rach there she is my perfectly proportioned wife don t look at me i never get his jokes  thank you  no no don t thank me thank you do you know there is not one thing i would change about you not one single thing and definitely not two single things okay you re being weird do you want sex or did you do something bad no no no i just love the way you look i am warm for your form okay you know the old classics like you know you look nice they re still okay but you look nice could mean that i m saying your face looks nice i want to compliment your body i mean i wouldn t change it at all and more specifically i wouldn t want anything to get any bigger  okay  i mean you wouldn t want any part of me to get any bigger would you don t answer that just when you thought that dude couldn t get any weirder why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger i don t know i mean what brought that on oh my god you know what we re trying to get pregnant so he s probably starting to freak out that my body s gonna change  you think that s what it is  you heard him no bigger you re perfect just don t get any bigger my god he sounded just like my highschool wrestling coach  i m gonna have to talk to chandler  yeah if you don t i will of course your body s gonna change your breasts are gonna get bigger your ass is gonna get bigger you re gonna lose bladder control god it s just such a magical time hi listen i wanted to ask you something about marriage now you re seeking me out to make jokes i mean i can see if we re all hanging out but to come to my home no i really want to know how you feel about it  why  mike doesn t ever want to get married  never  never wow are you still gonna move in with him i want to but i wanted you to tell me that marriage really isn t that big a deal you know that i won t be missing out on anything that marriage stinks yeah marriage stinks i mean if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving get them married  that s not how you really feel is it  no i m sorry i know it s not what you want to hear but i can t help it i love marriage seriously you divorceo if you have to call me a name i d prefer ross the divorcer it s just cooler look i know my marriages didn t exactly work out but you know i loved being that committed to another person and carol and i had some good times before she became a lesbian and once afterward anyway i m sorry it s okay that s how you feel but come on i mean living together will be great i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike  i do love mike  yeah see and you were so excited about moving in together before and you know what

rach perfection wouldn t change a thing not a thing  honey  yeah about that  i m going to change  yes but honey you don t have to i m gonna get bigger honey i i love your breasts the way they are fascist my breasts are gonna get bigger whether you like it or not and it s not just my breasts my ass is gonna get bigger too your ass  and don t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too  they do that  it s kind of a package deal god why why would you want to do that to yourself i thought it was something that we both wanted if it means that much to you i may be able to get onboard with the boobs but the giant ass and the big clown feet oh my god chandler if you can t handle this what will you be like in the hospital with the blood and screaming and the little person that s shooting out of her what joey why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job because she is  chandler knows i borrowed the money  for your boob job  joe  it s over okay so i m out 4000

day and i hope i was a little helpful  yeah you were helpful  yeah no thank you  good good because the more i thought about it the more i realized i don t think marriage is necessarily the right path for you what do you mean i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were all caught up in the whole soccermom thing but is that really you i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo they are awfully boxy i mean i don t know you d be so bored with marriage i mean it s so normal yeah hey can i help well we climbed up four flights of stairs maneuvered a narrow hallway dodged a rabid pit bull but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky you know sometimes your words they hurt hey where do you guys want this yeah seriously because this is really heavy i mean not for me because i m only pretending to hold it but for these guys just one last time on the marriage thing there s no wiggle room none at all no but you don t want to get married either right right except that i do want to get married couldn t have had this conversation down at the truck huh what you want to get married someday and hernia i haven t had a normal life and i never felt like i was missing out on anything but it feels like now it s my turn to have some of the regular stuff why didn t you say something before i didn t know how much i wanted it and i love you and i wanted to live with you i want to live with you too i mean let s do that but i don t think i can it was okay to move in when i didn t know what was gonna happen but i can t move in knowing nothing is ever gonna happen can we at least try living together you might change your mind about marriage are you gonna change yours no me neither i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want but i don t want this to end no i don t want it to end either i can t believe this is gonna end i guess i ll have my stuff picked up yeah okay okay so goodbye  take it easy mike  bye mike i m so sorry pheebs we re all sorry look on the bright side at least you won t have to live with this ugly chair that was here already huh i love you i did it i did it all right i d better take all i can carry who knows when i ll be able to get in here again huh english

harm in that that s how it starts i don t need to eat the cake i ll just smell the icing why not just a little sliver or okay just a slice or two the next thing you know you re 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide phoebe honey i know this is hard but look if you talk to him then you re gonna want to see him and if you see him you re gonna wanna get back together and i know

little pink pony named cotton oh i loved her so much i took her everywhere i would braid her tail make the transfer should i be concerned that a button fell off the old huggsy and i can t find it no don t worry about it i swallowed that years ago hey oh what i don t think she likes the new huggsy  but he s the same  i think she wants the old one back  yeah but he s the same  joey come on but he s

phoebe how did you even call him there s a speakerphone on the base unit base unit think monica think  look if i want to see phoebe and she  this doesn t concern you sorry i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name look guys you can t do this it s gonna make getting over each other harder not if nothing happens why can t we just hang out as friends sure if you re just gonna hang out as friends then maybe i ll join you you know i m your friend and mike s friend sit down make room for your friend  so how have you been  i ve been pretty good  you look really beautiful  thanks you look

way over here i saw this drunk guy throw up and then a pigeon ate it hey ross look i just wanted to apologize don t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me check this out so that s what i d look like if i worked out and was being serviced by a policeman you re not gonna actually send these out are you actually i don t need to because your little ross is dead joke didn t work okay there were no responses nobody posted anything nobody called my parents so the joke is on you nobody called nobody wrote anything nobody cares that i m dead oh my god  nobody cares that i m dead  oh come on you know that s not true what are you talking about you get 60 responses just for coming out of the closet i didn t get one response and i m dead well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community i can t believe this not even my geology lab partner and i carried that guy look let s think about this okay you think people are gonna disturb your family at this tragic time that people are gonna post condolences on a website this isn t about people not caring this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief  you re right there isn t a decent outlet  right i m sure if you had a funeral or memorial service tons of people would come exactly ross what are you doing you re having a memorial service for yourself no that would be stupid you re having it for me  ross don t press send don t press  no too late too late it s sent sorry so is that picture of you and the policeman i m trying to put emma down for a nap have you seen huggsy original or crappy  original  no sorry haven t seen him then what s that big lump under your covers  it s monica okay  that s not monica all right fine it s original huggsy i know emma wants him but he s mine and i need him she s being unreasonable joey there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don t cover its ears it s because it reminds her of her uncle joey  it does  yeah and she s comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much  really she loves me  oh yeah but you know what if you need huggsy don t worry emma will totally understand i won t but whatever okay wait a minute rach i mean if if huggsy means that much to emma then well she can have him oh sweet i knew uncle joey would step up  look emma look who s back  no forget it forget it i can t do it are you you re gonna take huggsy away from a little child how do you think i got him in the first place all right you two i m gonna go to the bathroom i don t want anything going on while i m gone here s a few things you can discuss mucus fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it i ve missed you so much i won t ask you to get back together i know we want different things but  just to be with you one more night  i want that too  but is that gonna make it too hard  it can t be any harder than this i mean if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time l i would have stopped to memorize your face

ross and you were so close oh we weren t but we had one class together he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science  i always remembered him  i m sure that would mean a lot to him and if heaven has a door i m sure he s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out i guess i really missed my chance no you didn t i m still alive kori i know this is a big surprise for you it s a long story but the things you just said really made my day the fact that you re here means more to me than if this room were filled with people you sick freak who does that i can t believe i had a crush on you did you hear that kori weston had a crush on me no mom i am not dead i know it s not something to kid about it was just a practical joke between chandler and me but it s over okay actually no even if i had died you would not be left childless monica english

wanted to kiss joey wow you mean like kiss him kiss him oh yeah i mean it was pretty intense  what brought that on  i don t know maybe it had to do with the fact i saw him do a love scene  a love scene with who  olivia olivia  i thought she was marrying connor  oh right real life more important  you think my dream means anything  i don t know i mean you saw him do a love scene maybe you don t have a thing for joey maybe you have a thing for drake well it was joey reading drake s lines in the dream of course it was trust me when it comes to psychology i know what i m talking about  i took two psych classes in college  you took the same class twice  it was hard  i know  hey  hi here monica look what i got to wear when i play at your restaurant wait right i think this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man phoebe maybe i wasn t clear before i really love listening to your music here but my restaurant it s sort of an upscale place right yeah okay i ll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault phoebe it s not what you wear it s sort of your songs i just don t think you should play at the restaurant anymore okay fine i ll just i ll take the hat back there hey so you guys the funniest thing happened at work the my songs aren t good enough for your restaurant okay we re still on that  i didn t say they weren t good enough  then what s wrong with them what they don t go with your tiny portions of pretentious food  tiny portions  yeah well excuse me i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but i can t see it i can t see it  phoebe it s not about quantity  well it s not about quality oh really you wanna talk about quality have you ever heard of a key it s what some people sing in well at least all my songs don t taste like garlic yeah there are other ingredients monica so that s what we re doing when i m in a coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs i m wearing earplugs  earplugs or cloves of garlic you know what i take back what i said before keep playing at the restaurant because with your music driving people inside my bar sales have gone up like crazy what are people having the garlic martini here s your bill we hope you enjoyed your stay oh we did and you still have all your lamps  i didn t factor in the room tax  dude don t worry about it i found an unattended maid s cart we re way ahead of the game  oh my god  what there s something new in the bowl  look we have enough just walk away  no but i want the pine cones  there s a forest right outside  it s not the same okay go quick thank you for a delightful stay my maple candy it s just you i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall you d better get back in that kitchen the garlic s not gonna overuse itself  okay you have to stop playing now  why the only person my playing is bothering is you  oh yeah let s settle this come on  get your garlic peelers off me excuse me excuse me hi i m monica geller i m the head chef here okay i was actually expecting a little applause there but whatever quick question by a show of hands how many of you were bothered by this woman s singing outside okay okay how many of you enjoyed the music outside let me ask you this question how many thought the music was fine but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant who identified this restaurant s tone as pretentiouscommagarlicky okay who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretension never hurt anyone okay well all right who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant polltaking excuse us all right here s a question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now well who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great  i m sorry  i m sorry too hey you wanna stick around and i ll whip you up some dinner yeah as long as it s free the food here is ridiculously overpr who hopes the handraising thing is still cute enough that you won t hate me joey do you have peanut butter on the back of your head oh man i thought i got it all how how i was making a peanut butter smoothie right i couldn t find this little plastic thingy that goes in the top of the blender and i thought well you know how important can that be right turns out very wow definitely just drake  what  how s it going with drake  i don t think it s going very well  what that scene i saw was so good well i m feeling really insecure about the one we re shooting tomorrow is this that thing you do when you say you re bad so i ll give you a compliment a little no i really am worried i have to make it convincing that i m in love with olivia  so  so i ve never played that oh honey it can t be that hard i mean you ve been in love before well just once with you okay well this could be a little awkward i m just gonna blow past it well look can t you just use that methodactor thing where you use your reallife memories to help you in your performance what the hell are you talking about all right look just try to remember how you felt when you were in love and think about that when you re playing the scene okay yeah i think i can do that yeah okay there s this party scene coming up and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her but he can t that makes me think about those times i wanted to grab you and kiss you but you didn t know so i would just pretend everything was cool but really it was killing me joey you never talked about that before hey you know what else i could use there s this scene where drake sneaks into olivia s bedroom and she doesn t know he s there which never happened with us i mean he knows he shouldn t be there but he just wants to look at her you know and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your makeup when i would think to myself my god she is beautiful and it hurt so much because i knew i could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you thanks dude this is great i got you something from vermont besides tampons and salt oh my god maple candy that s so sweet of you that s weird it s empty hi you guys what s going on you guys wanna hang out or do you guys hear a buzzing english

intelligence  and joey s raw sexual magnetism  those nerds would get laid  all right so ross you re okay with all this i mean  it s no big deal i just met her i m fine with it  god i forgot how hot she was  i m gonna get some more coffee   oh you know i ll come with you  okay   so a professor huh  yeah she is cool and she s so smart  her mind is totally acrimonious  guess that s not how she used it  i feel like i owe you an explanation  i don t ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties  i m  well i m kind of embarrassed i really hope you don t think less of me  think less of you no i don t think less of you  i mean you saw someone you liked and you kissed them  those people who like someone and don t kiss them  those people are stupid i hate those people  actually i m a little surprised at myself  i mean joey s so different from the guys i usually date  they re all professors intellectuals paleontologists mostly   you know very cerebral  yeah i know the type  if we want to grab a

to do it in a doctor s office  but it is okay to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell  i cannot believe ross told you that  and in my defense it was a wendy s  look i don t want to do these tests either  but i really do think it s a good idea  i m sure a doctor s office can t be worse  than on a class trip to the hershey factory  oh yeah rachel talks too 9980 who says wine has to cost more

lines and subtle impasto on this canvas monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself now do you have any idea what you just said no no my mouth says the words my brain is thinking monster trucks now remember when you get to the museum monet is not spelled monay i just  i wrote that out phonetically for you  phonetically yeah that means we just don t have time for this i gotta say i m really impressed you were able to memorize all this so quickly i m an actor i can memorize anything last week on days i had to say frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy  wow what does that mean  no idea but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means you ll get eaten by a bear okay  so let s move on to the renaissance  okay caravaggio uses chiaroscuro

are meant to have children i m sure it s gonna be just fine yeah yeah okay thanks i can t believe i didn t even think of that i guess i was so worried about having to come here and do that you can do it in a taco bell parking lot but you can t do it at a doctor s office it was a wendy s and that s the swedish national anthem thank you for asking wow lkea what a rich culture you know what i have a friend who s a masseuse  oh ja ja  ja  she s not very good though  and why do you think that is  i don t know maybe it s because she s got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you re such a highmaintenance tightass  phoebe  you know it s me well for like a half an hour man you can lie about sweden how can you come here  why didn t you tell me you work here  i don t have to tell you everything you do if you re gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage tip s not included why did you lie to me about working here because i was ashamed okay i sold out for the cash and they give me benefits like medical and dental and a fourohwunk but you know you pay a price now i m this corporate stooge and punching a clock and paying taxes phoebe honey if you hate it so much you should walk out there right now and quit be true to what you believe in honey you have principles and i so admire that i don t have any you know what you

well i m thinking that maybe joey isn t the right guy for me right now you know maybe i should be with someone i have more in common with you know what i mean yeah yeah but you know what i think you should give joey a chance i mean he s a great guy and sure he doesn t know that much about art but you can always talk about that with someone else  i guess that s true  lf you think about it he memorized all that stuff because he thought it was important to you you know that s the kind of guy joey is he is very sweet plus he is hot that was gonna be my next argument  you ready  yeah let s go wow  thanks ross  yeah hey ross that art stuff worked you hooked me up glad i could help man some of the stuff wasn t where you said it would be but i made it work it is not okay that i m aroused by

the one with the donor  ripped by mrnch dhnetmk  subtitles processed by subtitle editor c digital higherground  igor janevski  4114 fortunately she has a very pretty face  i still can t believe this my uterus is an inhospitable environment  i ve always tried so hard to be a good hostess  i can t believe my sperm have low motility  while i was growing up they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places   hi there  hi  i m sorry there wasn t better news from your tests last week  but i wanted to talk to you about your options  okay  even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren t great  you never know so keep having sex on a regular basis  oh damn it  don t worry after a while you ll tune it out  given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success  would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor  if you feel that neither of those is right for you you could always adopt  is that a hint  because we love you dr connelly but we don t want you to be our child  wow talk about an inhospitable environment  hi okay you ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping   let s do it  all right have a good time  not gonna find any clothes in there   hey you guys  hi  guess who s up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference   chris bailey  yeah right  when was the last time he made a submission deadline for an abstract  why are you laughing  just seeing what it d be like to be a paleontologist  it s fun yeah  so you re up for keynote speaker   who s deciding  professor sherman   i m meeting with him today  he s a pretty tough guy to impress  i think i know how to dazzle him  you re not gonna to do a magic trick are you  no   hey guys  i want to ask you something  i may get to speak at this paleontology convention  if i do i d love for you guys to come and hear me  i think i can safely say that we all have family issues work and or are sick   it s in barbados  but you come first  i m there   we ll see you guys  bye  see you   so how did it go at the fertility clinic  not as much fun as last time  apparently you only get porn if you re giving a sperm sample  so what did the doctor say  there s surrogacy but monica s dreamt her whole life of carrying a child  and she just felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her   so you re ruling out surrogacy  yeah  so i don t have to learn what that means  aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination  so we re talking about sperm donors  enough said i m there for you man where is she upstairs  how do you feel about all this  i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but there isn t one  come on ross be a good guy step up and do it  what  what  no i m not gonna give them ben  the data we re receiving from mri scans and dna testing  of these fossils are staggering  i mean we ve been accepting leakey s dates as a given  but if they re off by even a years or so  then you can just throw most of our assumptions  you know right in the trash 9965 so what i m saying is is that is that repercussions could be huge i mean not just in paleontology but if you think about it in evolutionary biology genetics geology i mean truly the mind boggles well that s not what you want  incentive for men  i ll take some of that  pheebs that s for men  i know when i go to the party later mike will know i m over him because i ll smell like another guy okay oh good i m dating a russian cabdriver seriously does anyone buy this i smell like beets i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads in them where are those on melanie griffith

chandler how a plane stays in the air  certainly that s a combination of bernoulli s principle  and newton s third law of motion  see  yeah that s the same as it has something to do with wind  i m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip  i should go too now tomorrow do you want to share a cab to the airport  or should mike and i meet you  mike who s mike   mike s your exboyfriend  that s right  oh yeah wow i had totally forgotten about him   that s a blast from the past huh  no it s okay honest mistake  it really doesn t mean anything i mean you know  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time   she does  let s get you out of here  well at least you took me down with you  i m so sorry i just i keep thinking about mike  i m crazy about david and we re having so much fun together  why why do i miss mike that s just that s gonna go away right   well i guess in time  yeah  i mean my feelings for richard are certainly gone  you just did it again chandler your feelings for chandler are certainly gone  boy phoebe s still pretty hung up on that mike huh  i wouldn t read too much into it  still a girl calls you by her exboyfriend s name  that s not a good thing right  let me stop you there  because i think i see where this is going i m not very good at giving advice  see if you want advice go to ross or monica or joey  for advice about pizza toppings or a burning sensation when you pee  i m sorry i just wish there was something i could do you know   well you know phoebe  seriously we re gonna do this  i m sorry i just wish i could make her forget about mike already   why did phoebe and mike break up  because his penis was too big  i m sorry that s the kind of thing i do  they broke up because mike didn t want to get married  what if you let phoebe know you d be open to marriage  that s great that s great i ll propose to her  what  i was probably going to do it at some point   no i didn t mean now  well why not it s brilliant  goodbye mike we ll see you at the wedding fella  well we probably won t invite you to the wedding but   well thank you chandler sincerely  well you re welcome  glad i could help   how do you think i should propose  i m pretending to read here  i m sorry  yeah how you doing hey how are you  you said you were gonna wear a thong where s the thong  i didn t mean a thong i meant thongs you really should have been more clear about that you re never gonna guess who i just saw downstairs britney spears yeah she never misses these conferences  no i just saw dr kenneth schwartz  oh my god  i know  did you talk to him oh yeah what am i gonna say to kenneth schwartz you could say hey kenny how come you re not britney spears  you ready to go  you re gonna go now  i thought we could hang out  i can t i have seminars all

good i have dinner plans  so you gonna be okay  yeah yeah i got tons of stuff i could do i m gonna hit the beach go swimming joe have you looked outside no why  oh man  there s an indoor pool  you could swim there  yeah i wasn t gonna swim i was gonna dig a hole that mike thing was interesting i don t know what s gonna happen with phoebe and david  i do want a hint huh i do i do okay i m sensing this is some kind of wordplay because you are pink with barely controlled glee  david s gonna propose to phoebe  what why because we were talking about ways he could beat mike and i told him phoebe wanted to get married chandler we have talked about this you are not supposed to give people advice couldn t you have made some inappropriate joke i did a penis one just so i know what was so wrong about what i said they ve only been going out for a few weeks phoebe is completely hung up on mike i mean she ll say no david s heart will be broken it ll be too hard for them to recover and then phoebe will end up alone again man that s some bad advice oh hey thank god you guys are here  what s going on  everything is upsidedown here it rains all day long and nobody watches tv and ross is famous i don t want to alarm anybody but monica s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed okay when i go places with high humidity it gets a little extra body okay that s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross i ll show you guys where to check in oh honey can you make sure we get a kingsize bed oh david get one for us too oh and see if they have a heartshaped one and with mirrors on the ceiling and make sure our room isn t next to theirs oh you guys are so lucky you re here with people you know it s just such a romantic place i just wish i could share it with a guy  not joey  not joey no  i was just lusting after chandler  yeah right so i m proposing to phoebe tonight tonight isn t an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond oh there it is yes well being a failed scientist doesn t pay quite as well as you might think that s oneseventieth of a carat and the clarity is quite poor nice  monica can i talk to you for a second  okay david s gonna propose to phoebe tonight see what happens when you give people advice  well i hope you told him not to  that would be advice okay fine i ll handle this  phoebe  yeah  i need to talk to you  are you leaving the supremes okay my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice david s gonna propose to you tonight wow really that s fantastic what are you serious you want to marry him  what about mike  oh

amazing woman and the time we spent apart was unbearable of course the sanitation strikes in minsk didn t help sure okay yeah but well now that we re together again i don t ever want to be apart so to that end  oh my god mike  it s david actually no mike s here oh hey mike hi david chandler monic oh it s the humidity  hi phoebe  what are you doing here i have a question i need to ask you i have a question i was kind of gonna ask her myself yeah i understand but before you do she really needs to hear this okay  would you care for my seat as well  actually yeah that d be great well that s fair you ve had a long trip phoebe i love you i ve missed you so much these last few months i thought we were apart for a good reason but i realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you kind of steps on the toes of what i was going to say i m sorry david but she really has to know this all right but after this i want to see you outside if the rain stops you re the most incredible woman i ve ever met how could i lose you now i don t actually have a ring  i have a ring  i wouldn t brag about that big guy but phoebe will you marry me no i love you but i never needed a proposal from you i just needed to know we were headed somewhere  that we had a future  we can have any future you want okay well i m gonna take off david i m so sorry i m sorry just so i know if i had asked first yeah i might have said yes but that would ve been wrong please you don t have to explain i mean perhaps if i hadn t gone to minsk things would have worked out for us and i wouldn t have ruined my career or lost that toe to frostbite it was a good trip  is it okay if i hug you now  oh yes because of our meddling all right oh isn t this nice it s so quiet i could just lie here all day oh i know  open your drapes open your drapes  so glad we got adjoining rooms  the sun is out  hey remember when i had corneas go to the pool and reserve chairs  i will get the magazines and the lotion  ladies ross speech is in 45 minutes  no  damn it walls are pretty thin guys then we have to weigh the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of carbon dating look at the woman sitting out by the pool getting tan she s all leathery and wrinkled i m so jealous finally factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered y i giganotosaurus  argentinosaurus  not to mention coldsaurus and that s just the herbivores i m not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development really but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is thought to be a separate species from homo erectus   what  he said erectus  you re kidding right  no he really said it and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossils and the example of homo erectus  erectus y i  homo  right in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21 st century thank you  really great  oh thanks guys i thought it was wonderful jarvis oberblau cornell i mean the ideas you put forth and from someone so young and okay now we re just holding hands alrighty we re gonna hit the beach that was really great  oh thank you  yeah oh and so funny  take it easy  all right thanks thanks so much i can t tell you how much it means that you were here you kidding we wouldn t have missed it i m back okay well excuse me  well  you were incredible you blew them away i can t tell you how great it was to

charlie and i broke up no why well she said we have nothing in common that s crazy no it s not we have nothing in common  yeah that s true  yeah i mean she should be with someone more like ross you

just happen a little bit  no it can t happen at all  why not because look no one wants this to happen more than me okay i have gone over this moment in my head 100 times and not once did i ever say no i couldn t do it to ross  but that wasn t gonna stop you before  i know i know but i ve thought about it a lot since then and it just wouldn t be right i m sorry i m sorry too  oh god i shouldn t have said anything  no no no no no no hey we ll be fine  like you said it s no big deal  it s not a big deal  no big deal  it s so not a big deal  i ll see you later all right hey  okay great okay oh i m

by monica right now this is the first time in our marriage that i ve felt like the more attractive one all right come on mike you can beat her knock that dog off her head  damn it  i sleep with him  game point  don t get too cocky remember i won the last one oh by the way how did that feel losing to a girl you should look in the mirror before you call yourself that  no no no  and that s how it s done okeydokey you ve each won a game and i ve lost what s felt like a year of my life everybody goes home a winner  best of three  that s what i m thinking should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil  serve the ball chump  serve the ball chump okay better comebacks mike better comebacks i m just saying i have a cabin in the adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city well that d be just nifty well i ve kind of got a lot on my plate right now not that i wouldn t love a weekend in the country with a strange man  jarvis  oh you re back  this is my wife nancy  well get out  ross can i talk to you for a minute  yes please so what s going on well joey and i broke up  oh my god what happened  joey is a great guy but we re just we re so different i mean like during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus i knew that was him anyway i just i think it s for the best  hey hey you okay  i guess there was there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone else okay geller last day of the conference you know what happens to the keynote speaker professor klarik we re in the middle of a conversation here  can t you throw him in the pool later  or we could throw you both in now okay gentlemen please aren t we a little old for this i mean we re scientists all right we re academics and most importantly you will have to catch us first go go go okay so it s tied again 41 to 41  okay look enough is enough  no  i just have two more points to beat him  monica that was also true an hour ago i mean please look at you your hand is blistered you can barely stand your hair is inexplicable you ve already proven you re just as good as he is we missed our dinner reservations so let s just go upstairs order room service take a shower and shave your head i can t just walk away i ve put in four hours you knew this about me when you married me you agreed to take me in sickness and in health well this is my sickness  what about the obsessive cleaning  that s just good sense  you okay  no honey i m okay shake it off oh no shaking no shaking no shaking oh my god i can t play  so you forfeit  mike wins i can t believe it i lost  no you didn t  what  because i m gonna play for you  you can t do that it s okay i don t care which of them i beat okay we re taking that paddle home mister  honey you don t have to do this  yes i do i may not understand why you have to win so badly but if it s important to you it s important to me because i love you but you suck you re welcome sweetheart all right let s get this over with sudden death  whoever wins this point wins  okay  oh my god you re good  it s like watching porn and that s how it s done oh my god oh my god that was so amazing well when did you hold on i almost forgot loser  when did you stop sucking  i never sucked i just didn t want you to know how good i was  why  i don t know  well this is so great  now we can enter doubles tournaments  that s why  they still looking for us  yeah the bartender said they split up into two search parties the herbivores and the carnivores you know we as a group are not the coolest oh look out  i don t think they saw us  i don t think they did so i started to tell you something earlier there was another reason that i realized it was time to end it with joey i kind of realized i was starting to have feelings for someone else and can i ask who i think you know i think i know too but i ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past so  i m sorry we can t  all right all right i mean you just went out with my best friend you know i just think it would be a really really bad idea or not i mean what english
