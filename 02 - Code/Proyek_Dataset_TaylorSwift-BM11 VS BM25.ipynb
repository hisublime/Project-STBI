don know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet  stranger will pass that person and see  faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about  person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip

post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday well meet someone who

from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that why  still so in love with song writing so what ve done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so ll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how  put songs together  sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because  always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so  always wanna be prepared  wanted to send him the idea that  was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said  can stand that  wanna work on something else think of something else so  just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where  wanted to go with the song how  saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called  know places so this was the voice memo  sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii na na na na waiting at the back door theyre around and the vultures come around and you know that they won they won us say what they want bout say what they want bout us and you come and sing and listen  would not think about it but  not done every know that  thing or two about it thing or two about it  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run baby  know some places we won be found and theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause   know places we can hide  know places  know places uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places or whatever  don know but that basically just like  dark really dark lyric like thing and it about like everybody like trying to get into and ruin  love or whatever and it like you just whatever you know and the would just go to that major and just be like ooh so  hope you like it it wouldn be  piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now  just making weird sounds hope you like it', 'and it  sad picture the final blow hits you somebody else gets what you wanted again and you know it all

we crave romance we long for those rare enchanting moments when things just fall into place above all else we really really want our lives to be filled with love ve decided that in this life  want to be defined by the things  love not the things  hate the things  afraid of or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night those things may be struggles but theyre not my identity  wish the same

the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them may you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you didn  hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed  hope that if there is  lover in your life it someone who deserves you if that the case  hope you

constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we arent allowed to age its an

impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what  know now to be more valuable about  person is not their charming routine upon meeting them  call it  solid first 5 but the

my thoughts on the matter you should know that youre reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dyingit just coming alive there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity  am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into  body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently in recent years youve probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl  meetis that they all realize their worth and ask for it music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for it my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album price point is  hope they don underestimate themselves or undervalue their art arrows through the heart in mentioning album sales  like to point out that people are still buying albums but now theyre buying just  few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren alone in feeling so alone it isn as easy today as it was 0 years ago to have  multiplatinumselling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people lives forever the way  see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun  passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for  month while the song is  huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans  think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon  think forming  bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no  did not say shock  said surprise  believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why can this love affair exist between an artist and their fans in the youtube generation we live in  walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before  brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe  hope the next generation artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be there are  few things  have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs  haven been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with  frontfacing camera the only memento kids these days want is  selfie it part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram fan power  friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers  see this becoming  trend in the music industry for me this dates back to 005 when  walked into my first recordlabel meetings explaining to them that  had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fansnot the other way around another theme  see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like countryand to me that incredible progress  want to make music that reflects all of my influences and  think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of  careerdefining path and more of an organizational tool this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only acceptedit is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take  risk at all celebrity spotlight  predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the 70s 80s and 90s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and  suspect ll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be  bad girl vs good girlcleancut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist  just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to and as for me ll just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain  life rooted in this same optimism and  also like

good music and everything  swear  not  stalker laughing radio dj well taylor swift the funny thing about this song is ya know as  writer some of the songs that you write like four hours youll do them writing  song and itll be good and everything but  wrote this one in literally 5 minutes and ya know  really didn think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so  kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be  single but um my label heard it and was like were putting that outlaughing tim mcgraw well  glad ya did cause um it doing well for ya radio dj so  so  understand that you two guys have not talked tim mcgraw no radio dj you haven met tim mcgraw no taylor swift no weve never talked or met or anything tim mcgraw  sent her  message one time  think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh  don remember what show it was  was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so  sent her  little message so  don know if she got it or not taylor swift oh my god they never gave that to me tim mcgraw they didn okay well there ya go  did laughing radio dj so ii taylor swift weve just officially never never talked or

definitely kind of  chance ya know  didn say anything bad in the song so  was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn take it too bad tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad

write  song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing  actually this this is kinda strange but  actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school tim mcgraw now  feel old taylor swift and um  was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and  was going through  period where  was dating this guy that was going off to college and  knew we were gonna break up so  started to think about all the things that  knew would remind him of me and it kinda like  given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are tim mcgraw aww thank you taylor swift and uh you know so  kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if  was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that  shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time  was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well that your first single laughing taylor swift and  like well tim mcgraw well you can write songs about me anytime taylor laughing taylor swift that awesome there  part two coming out next month tim mcgraw alright great laughing tim

places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character does its something  scott fitzgerald did so well to describe  scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for  moment  highly biased but  think that the way music can transport you back to  longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when  hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks  instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in  little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania  clutching  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for  gig at  coffee house when  hear  write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when  hear how to save  life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile  immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when  get  day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing  van with my band and crew  would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds  convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs  love writing songs because  love preserving memories like putting  picture frame around  feeling you once had  like to use nostalgia as inspiration when  writing songs for the same reason  like to take photographs  like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times  want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever the fun challenge of writing  pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of  thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into  genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you think that as pop writers were supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones  think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and  dont mean in  shakespearean sonnet type of way although  love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 009 in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour  got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to  young woman from cuba singing about havana  think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what  went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic  think  lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator  hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it this alliance between  song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like  great book', 'taylor swift  promise that youll never find another like me taylor swift  know that   handful baby uh

slip and break cause it very important to me jamil takes the award from swift to hold thank you so much she so supportive we all need someone like that  taylor good evening  wanna first thank billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for microphone stand lowers whoa this is going great so far excellent okay  wanna say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade well it means ve seen  lot when this decade began  was 0 years old and  had put out my selftitled debut album when  was 6 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called fearless and  saw that there was  world of music and experience beyond country music that  was really curious about  saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time and  saw that as  female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you whether you deserve to be there whether your male producer or cowriter is the reason for your success or whether it was  savvy record label it wasn  saw that people love to explain away  woman success in the music industry and  saw something in me change due to this realization this was the decade when  became  mirror for my detractors whatever they decided  couldn do is exactly what  did audience claps huh ll take it thanks whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples  can think of are songs like mean shake it off and blank space basically if people had something to say about me  usually said something back in my own way and this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win album of the year at the grammys and  did become the youngest artist to ever win the award with that win came criticism and backlash in 00 that  never experienced before as  young new artist all of  sudden people had doubts about my singing voice was it strong enough was   little bit pitchy all of  sudden they weren sure if  was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past  had had cowriters in the room at that time  couldn understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard  believe  popular headline back then was  swift backlash which is clever you gotta give it to them and now  realize that this is just what happens to  woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people comfort level  now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback but  didn know that then so then  decided that  would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that  would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in  live show  decided  would be what they said  couldn be  didn know then that soon enough people would decide on something else  wasn quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and  would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics theyre saying  dating too much in my twenties okay ll stop ll just be single for years now theyre saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs okay ll make one about moving to new york and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends oh theyre saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music alright okay here an entire genre shift and  pop album called 989 audience cheers oh you heard it sick now it that  showing you too many pictures of me with my friends okay  can stop doing that too now  actually  calculated manipulator rather than  smart businesswoman okay ll disappear from public view for years now  being cast as  villain to you okay here an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere in the last ten years  have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about  male artist  really like his songs but  don know what it is there just something about him  don like no that criticism is reserved for us but you know ve learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art ve watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade lana del rey was ruthly criticized someone in the audience cheers yes yeah thank you we have similar tastes  like it she was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into in my opinion the most influential artist in pop her vocal stylings her lyrics her aesthetics theyve been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the grammys because she just kept making art and that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us and  see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work  absolutely love  see it in lizzo rosalía tayla parx hayley kiyoko king princess camila cabello halsey megan thee stallion princess nokia nina nesbitt sigrid normani her maggie rogers becky  dua lipa ella mai billie eilish and so many other amazing women who are making music right now female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music onstage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast we are held at  higher sometimes impossiblefeeling standard and it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it it seems like the pressure that couldve crushed us made us into diamonds instead and what didn kill us actually did make us stronger but we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in ar meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields these women are still struggling to even have  chance to be in the room audience cheers we now find ourselves fully immersed in  vast frontier that wasn around last decade and that is the streaming world in music were always walking handinhand with technology and sometimes that is so awesome like how now were able to just drop  song that we made yesterday ve spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes  still don think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up and  hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers songwriters and creators don you audience claps lately there been  new shift that has affected me personally and that  feel is  potentially harmful force in our industry and as your resident loud person  feel the need to bring it up and that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate as if it an app or  shoe line this just happened to me without my approval consultation or consent after  was denied the chance to purchase my music outright my entire catalogue was sold to scooter braun ithaca holdings in  deal that  told was funded by the soros family capital and the carlyle group yet to this day none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly to perform their due diligence on their investment on their investment in me to ask how  might feel about the new owner of my art the music  wrote the videos  created photos of me my handwriting my album designs and of course scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale or even when it was announced  fairly certain he knew how  would feel about it though and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but he always been nice to me when  raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music and of course he nice to you if youre in this room you have something he needs the fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think according to his own social media post that he could buy me but  obviously not going willingly yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and  will never ever forget it like ever audience laughs but to conclude  will say that in ten years ve seen forward steps in our industry in our awareness our inclusion our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct ve seen the advent of social media the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists and ve seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before ve leaned on that support and it has kept me in  place where no matter what  always wanted to keep making music for them  was up on  stage in new york city in 04 accepting billboard woman of the year and  was talking about the future of streaming how we needed to make sure that the female artists writers and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly this was before my record deal with universal last year that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their spotify shares unrecupable so thank you for that audience cheers this speech  referring to was on my 5th birthday  about to turn thirty tonight woo but my exact quote during this speech was  really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to  younger generation of musicians because somewhere right now your future woman of the year is probably sitting in  piano lesson or in  girls choir and today right now we need to take care of her ve since learned that at that exact moment an year old girl in california really was taking piano lessons and really was in  girls choir and this year she has been named woman of the year at the age of seventeen her name is billie audience cheers and those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry the ones where people dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people the ones where fans feel  connection to music that makes their day easier makes their night more fun makes their love feel more sacred or their heartache feel less isolating the ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love music and no matter what else enters the conversation we will bring it back to music and as for me lately ve been focusing less on doing what they say  can do and more on doing whatever the hell  want thank you for  magnificent happy free confused sometimes lonely but mostly golden decade  honored to be here tonight  feel very lucky to be with you thank you so much', 'salt air and the rust on your door  never needed anything more oh whispers of are you sure never have  ever before but  can see

holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music  feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans  respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created  legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering  free month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months  find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company this is not about me thankfully  am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for  quarter of  years worth of plays on his or her songs these are not the complaints of  spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  realize that apple is working towards  goal of paid streaming  think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out three months is  long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing  say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done  hope that soon  can join them in the progression towards  streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music  think this could be the platform that gets it right but  say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation taylor', 'lyrics for this song have yet to be released

6th in which ll be voting in the state of tennessee in the past ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years  feel very differently about that now  always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights  believe we all deserve in this country  believe in the fight for lgbtq rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong  believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalent  cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all americans no matter their skin color gender or who they love running for senate in the state of tennessee is  woman named marsha blackburn as much as  have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office  cannot support marsha blackburn her voting record in congress appalls and terrifies me she voted against equal pay for women she voted against the reauthorization of the violence against women act which attempts to protect women from domestic violence stalking and date rape she believes businesses have  right to refuse service to gay couples she also believes they should not have the right to marry these are not my tennessee values  will be voting for phil bredesen for senate and jim cooper for house of representatives please please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values for  lot of us we may never find  candidate or party with whom we agree 00 on every issue but we have to vote anyway so many intelligent thoughtful selfpossessed people have turned 8 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count but first you need to register which is quick and easy to do october 9th is the last day to register to vote in the state of tn go to voteorg and you can find all the info happy voting', 'drew looks at me  fake  smile so he won see that  want and  needing everything that we should be pre ll bet she beautiful that girl he talks about
